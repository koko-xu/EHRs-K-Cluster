The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.  The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.,DIAGNOSES,1.  HEMATURIA.,2.  PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.,3.  SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.,4.

              " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 71-year-old female who I am seeing for the first time.  She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for the last 6 years.  She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.  She says when this started she had significant joint pains and was unable to walk.  She had pain in the hands and feet.  Currently, she has no pain in any of her joints.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Denies photosensitivity, oral or nasal ulcer, seizure, psychosis, and skin rashes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and left BKA.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  BP 130/70, heart rate 80, and respiratory rate 14.,HEENT:  EOMI.

No organomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  No edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Deferred.,ARTICULAR:  She has swelling of bilateral wrists, but no significant tenderness.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs in chart was reviewed.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  A 71-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, on longstanding prednisone.  She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.',\n",

              " 'Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.',\n",

History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.

Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.,Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  I will continue to follow up.',\n",

              " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 43-year-old male who was recently discharged from our care on the 1/13/06 when he presented for shortness of breath. He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.,MEDICATIONS:, Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.,HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.,NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.,CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.,ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.,EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.,PLAN:, The patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.\",\n",

The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic.  The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November.  He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X.  Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort.  He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.

The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia.  I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery.  He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment.  I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump.  He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point.  This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today.  They were in agreement with this plan.  We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag.  To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this.,',\n",

Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.\",\n",

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia.  However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible.  Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours.  We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture.  If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.,As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH.  Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.,2.  Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above.  No immediate indication for anticoagulation.  If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy.  This was discussed with Dr. X.

He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.

A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient’s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient’s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.  Patient was encouraged to call in blood sugars at the end of the week if they are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial.

There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well.  DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles.,I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a \"good day.\"  I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a \"bad day,\" he will have nowhere else to turn.  I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night.  It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night.  I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night).  I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping.  The patient is agreeable to this.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Lumbar muscle strain.,2.  Chronic back pain.,PLAN: , At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible.  Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex.  He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet.  I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally.  If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y.',\n",

His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient\\'s self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.',\n",

He is unemployed, presumably on disability and lives with his partner.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , \"I\\'m in jail because I was wrongly arrested.\" The patient is admitted on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,On the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.,I was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient\\'s longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient\\'s dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient\\'s partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was \"useful, but not dosed high enough.\" Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  The patient is fairly vague on his history of AIDS related conditions, but does identify the following:  Thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections; additional details of these problems are not currently known.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his partner.  He is unemployed.  Details of his educational and occupational history are not currently known.  His source of finances is also unknown, though social security disability is presumed.,SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY: , The patient smoked one to two packs per day for most of the last year, but has increased this to two to three packs per day in the last month.  His partner reports that the patient consumed alcohol occasionally, but denies any excessive or binge use recently.  The patient reports smoking marijuana a few times in his life, but not recently.  Denies other illicit substance use.,LEGAL HISTORY:  ,Unknown.,GENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  Also unknown.,MENTAL STATUS EXAM:,Attitude:  The patient demonstrates only variable cooperation with interview, requires frequent redirection to respond to questions.  His appearance is cachectic.  The patient is poorly groomed.,Psychomotor:  There is no psychomotor agitation or retardation.  No other observed extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia.,Affect:  His affect is fairly detached.,Mood:  Describes his mood is \"okay.\",Speech:  His speech is normal rate and volume.  Tone, his volume was decreased initially, but this improved during the course of the interview.,Thought Process:  His thought processes are markedly tangential.,Thought content:  The patient is fairly scattered.  He will provide history with frequent redirection, but he does not appear to stay on one topic for any length of time.  He denies currently auditory or visual hallucinations, though his partner says that this is a feature present at baseline.  Paranoid delusions are elicited.,Homicidal/Suicidal Ideation:  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Denies previous suicide attempts.,Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person and year only.  His memory is intact to names of his Madison Clinic providers.,Insight/Judgment:  His insight is absent as evidenced by his repeated questioning of the validity of his AIDS and mental health diagnoses.  His judgment is poor as evidenced by his longstanding pattern of minimal engagement in treatment of his mental health and physical health conditions.,Assets:  His assets include his housing and his history of supportive relationship with his partner over many years.,Limitations:  His limitations include his AIDS and his history of poor compliance with treatment.,FORMULATION:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old white male with a history of schizophrenia and AIDS.  He was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.  It is unclear to me how much his presentation is a direct expression of an AIDS-related condition, though I suspect the impact of his HIV status is likely to be substantial.,DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Schizophrenia by history.  Rule out AIDS-induced psychosis.  Rule out AIDS-related cognitive disorder.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  AIDS (stable by his report).  Anemia.,AXIS IV:  Relationship strain and the possibility that he may be unable to return to his home upon discharge; minimal engagement in mental health and HIV-related providers.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment Functioning is currently 15.,PLAN: , I will attempt to increase the database, will specifically request records from the last mental health providers.  The Internal Medicine Service will evaluate and treat any acute medical issues that could be helpful to collaborate with his providers at Clinic regarding issues related to his AIDS diagnosis.  With the patient\\'s permission, I will start quetiapine at a dose of 100 mg at bedtime, given the patient\\'s partner report of partial, but response to this agent in the past.  I anticipate titrating further for effect during the course of his admission.',\n",

              " \"HISTORY: , The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety.  The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals.  The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.,STUDY:,  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.,ORAL STAGE:  ,The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE:  ,No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.,PLAN:  ,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.,2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.,The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.,Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.  She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services.\",\n",

The proximal part looks like it is in good position.  The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement.  There is no significant angulation.  The joint itself appears to be intact.  The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint.  I do not see any extra blood in the joint.  I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign.,I spoke with Dr. X.  He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up.  At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision.  The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time.,Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow.,He had much better comfort once this was applied.  There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort.,Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass.,We then gave him a sling.,We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go.  Gave him a prescription for #15 more and warned him to take it only at nighttime and use Tylenol or Motrin, and ice in the daytime.,I gave him the name and telephone number of Dr. X whom they can follow up with.

He is HLA-B27 negative.,PLAN:,  In terms of the plan, I discussed with him what things he should be taking and the fact that since he has persistent symptoms, he should be on medication every day.  I am going to switch him to Indocin 75 mg SR just to give more sustained effect to his joints, and if he does not respond to this or continue with the symptoms, we may need to get an MRI.  We will see him back in three months.  He was evaluated by our physical therapist, who gave him some recommendations in terms of exercise for his lower extremities.  Future plans for A may include physical therapy and more stronger medications as well as imaging studies with an MRI.  Today he received his flu shot.

              " \"EXAM:  ,Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy.,HISTORY: , 30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder.  The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.  Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.,3.  Suspicious mammographic findings.  The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied.  Further pathologic analysis is pending.,BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.,MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:,1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.,2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.,3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.\",\n",

MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Negative aside from above.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,Please see above.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative aside from above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.,DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\",\n",

Dr. XYZ had performed right and left facet and sacroiliac joint injections, subsequent right L3 to S1 medial branch blocks and radiofrequency ablation on the right from L3 to S1.  She was subsequently seen with some mid back pain and she had right T8-T9 and T9-T10 facet injections on 10/28/2004.  She was last seen on 04/08/2005 with recurrent pain in her low back on the right.  Dr. XYZ repeated her radiofrequency ablation on the right side from L3-S1 on 05/04/2005.,The patient comes back to see me today.  She states that the radiofrequency ablation has helped her significantly there, but she still has one spot in her low back that seems to be hurting her on the right, and seems to be pointing to her right sacroiliac joint.  She is also complaining of pain in both knees.  She says that 20 years ago she had a cortisone shot in her knees, which helped her significantly.  She has not had any x-rays for quite some time.  She is taking some Lortab 7.5 mg tablets, up to four daily, which help her with her pain symptoms.  She is also taking Celebrex through Dr. S’ office.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unchanged from my visit of 04/08/2005.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female.,Vital Signs:  Height is 5 feet 5 inches.

Physical exam findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.\",\n",
              " \"SUMMARY OF CLINICAL HISTORY:,  The patient was a 35-year-old African-American male with no significant past medical history who called EMS with shortness of breath and chest pain.  Upon EMS arrival, patient was tachypneic at 40 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 90%.  At the scene, EMS administered breathing treatments and checked lung sounds that did not reveal any evidence of fluid in the lung fields.  EMS also reports patient was agitated upon their arrival at his residence.  Two minutes after arrival at UTMB at 1500, the patient became unresponsive, apneic, and had oxygen saturations from 80-90%.  The patient's heart rate decreased to asystole, was intubated with good breath sounds and air movement.  Patient then had wide complex bradycardia and ACLS protocol for pulseless electrical activity was followed for 45 minutes.  The patient was administered TPA with no improvement.  Bedside echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion.  The patient was administered D5W, Narcan, and multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate.  The patient had three episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation with cardioversion/defibrillation resulting in asystole.  The patient was pronounced dead at 1605 with fixed, dilated pupils, no heart sounds, no pulse and no spontaneous respirations.,DESCRIPTION OF GROSS LESIONS,EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:,  The body is that of a 35-year-old well-developed, well-nourished male.  There is no peripheral edema of the extremities.  There is an area of congestion/erythema on the upper chest and anterior neck.  There are multiple small areas of hemorrhage bilaterally in the conjunctiva.  A nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are in place.  There is an intravenous line in the right hand and left femoral region.  The patient has multiple lead pads on the thorax.  The patient has no other major surgical scars.,INTERNAL EXAMINATION (BODY CAVITIES):,  The right and left pleural cavity contains 10 ml of clear fluid with no adhesions.  The pericardial sac is yellow, glistening without adhesions or fibrosis and contains 30 ml of a straw colored fluid.  There is minimal fluid in the peritoneal cavity.,HEART:,  The heart is large with a normal shape and a weight of 400 grams.  The pericardium is intact.  The epicardial fat is diffusely firm.  As patient was greater than 48 hours post mortem, no TTC staining was utilized.  Upon opening the heart was grossly normal without evidence of infarction.  There were slightly raised white plaques in the left ventricle wall lining.  The left ventricle measures 2.2 cm, the right ventricle measures 0.2 cm, the tricuspid ring measures 11 cm, the pulmonic right measures 8 cm, the mitral ring measures 10.2 cm, and the aortic ring measures 7 cm.  The foramen ovale is closed.  The circulation is left dominant.  Examination of the great vessels of the heart reveals minimal atherosclerosis with the area of greatest stenosis (20% stenosis) at the bifurcation of the LAD.,AORTA:,  There is minimal atherosclerosis with no measurable plaques along the full length of the ascending and descending aorta.,LUNGS: , The right lung weighed 630 grams, the left weighed 710 grams.  The lung parenchyma is pink without evidence of congestion of hemorrhage.  The bronchi are grossly normal.  In the right lung, there are two large organizing thrombo-emboli.  The first is located at the first branch of the pulmonary artery with an older, organizing area adherent to the vessel wall measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 2.5 cm.  Surrounding this organizing area is a newer area of apparent thrombosis completely occluding the bifurcation.  The other large organizing, adherent embolus is located further in out in the vasculature measuring approximately 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.5 cm.  There are multiple other emboli located in smaller pulmonary vessels that show evidence of distending the vessels they are located inside.,GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:,  The esophagus and stomach are normal in appearance without evidence of ulcers or varices.  The stomach contains approximately 800 ml, without evidence of any pills or other non-foodstuff material.  The pancreas shows a normal lobular cut surface with evidence of autolysis.  The duodenum, ileum, jejunum and colon are all grossly normal without evidence of abnormal vasculature or diverticula.  An appendix is present and is unremarkable.  The liver weighs 2850 grams and the cut surface reveals a normal liver with no fibrosis present grossly.  The gallbladder is in place with a probe patent bile duct through to the ampulla of Vater.,RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM:,  The spleen is large weighing 340 grams, the cut surface reveals a normal appearing white and red pulp.  No abnormally large lymph nodes were noted.,GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:,  The right kidney weighs 200 grams, the left weighs 210 grams.  The left kidney contains a 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 simple cyst containing a clear fluid.  The cut surface reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla with intact calyces.  The prostate and seminal vessels were cut revealing normal appearing prostate and seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of inflammation or embolus.,ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:,  The adrenal glands are in the normal position and weigh 8.0 grams on the right and 11.6 grams on the left.  The cut surface of the adrenal glands reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla.  The thyroid gland weighs 12.4 grams and is grossly normal.,EXTREMITIES:,  Both legs and calves were measured and found to be very similar in circumference.  Both legs were also milked and produced no clots in the venous system.,CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION,This patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature., ,The most significant finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung.  The autopsy revealed evidence of multiple emboli in the right lung that were at least a few days old because the emboli that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall.  In order to be adherent to the vessel wall, the emboli must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response, which takes at least a few days.  The fatal event was not the old emboli in the right lung, but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery.  This created a high-pressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the patient's demise.,Although this case is fairly straight forward in terms of what caused the terminal event, perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35-year-old man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism.  Virchow's triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury, stasis and a hypercoagulable state as possible etiologies.  The age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis as the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed.  The autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the occlusion.  The next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state.  Some possibilities include obesity, trauma, surgery, cancer, Factor V Leiden deficiency (as well as other inherited disorders-prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, and disorders of plasminogen), and Lupus anticoagulant.  Of these risks factors, obesity was the only risk factor the patient was known to have.  The patient had no evidence of trauma, surgery, cancer or the stigmata of SLE, therefore these are unlikely.  Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable state (Factor V Leiden being the most common).,In summary, this patient died of a pulmonary embolism, the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined.  A definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory tests and a more detailed history.,SUMMARY AND REFLECTION,WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS AUTOPSY:,  I learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious, the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive.  This patient was an otherwise completely healthy 35-year-old man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable state.,REMAINING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS:,  Basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined.  Once that question is answered I believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the patient's family.\",\n",

She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.

She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.',\n",

              " 'SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.',\n",

              " 'HISTORY: , The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.,On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.,OBJECTIVE:,  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.,2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.,MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ.  If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future.',\n",
              " 'SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today’s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient’s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.',\n",

We will stop Lipitor, have her follow up in one month which she has already got planned for diabetes appointment and check symptoms at that time.  Certainly if her pain improves might consider something like Crestor, which is more water soluble, which may cause less adverse effects.  We will check her comprehensive metabolic panel to make sure the alkaline phosphatase is okay, may need an x-ray of back, hip, and legs at that time if symptoms are not gone.,2.  Hypercholesterolemia, this is somewhat bothersome as she is a diabetic.  Did discuss with her that we need to stick to the diet especially after going off of Lipitor.  We will see how she does with her bone pain/leg pain off of Lipitor.  If she has improvement may consider Crestor in one month.  I am going to check her lipid panel and a CMP.  Apparently, she is going to get this at a different site, Mapleridge in Wichita.,3.  Type II diabetes.  We will decrease her Glucovance because she is having frequent low blood sugars.  Her previous hemoglobin A1c was 5.6 so we will see if this improves her symptoms.

At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds.  She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop.  She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep.  She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative.  Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy.  She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then.

He was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X.  This is the first time that I have met the patient.  The patient's history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an HIV-associated complication.  He is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for approximately one year.  He had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3.  When he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his HAART regimen.  Since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his HIV and is seeing Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic.  He is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy.  His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350.  He has had no HIV complications since he was last seen in our clinic.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic, here in ABCD, although he has not seen her in approximately one year.  The patient has an AV fistula that was placed in late 2006.  The latest blood work that I have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a GFR of 22 and a potassium of 5.9.  These laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation.  The only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping.  He was given Ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping.  He says that he has trouble getting to sleep.  The Ambien will allow him to sleep for about two hours, and then he is awake again.  He is tired during the day, but is not taking any daytime naps.

Renal.  His serum creatinine is progressively worsening.  His creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and today is 4.3.  This represents a GFR of 19.  This is stage IV chronic kidney disease.  He does have vascular access and this appears to be ready to use.  He is having some difficulty sleeping and it is possible that this represents some early signs of uremia.  Otherwise, he has no signs or symptoms of uremia at this time.  I am going to touch base with the dialysis educator and try to get The patient in to the dialysis teaching classes.  He has already received some literature for the dialysis teaching, but has not yet enrolled in the classes.  I have encouraged him to continue to exercise his right forearm.  I am also going to contact the transplant coordinator and see if he can be evaluated for possible transplant.  Given his progression of his chronic kidney disease, I will anticipate that he will need to start dialysis soon.,2.  Hypertension.  I have added labetolol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen.  He shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his Lasix could be increased.  Goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.,3.  Hyperkalemia.  I am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily.  I will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium.  If his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.,4.  Bone metabolism.  His PTH is elevated and I am going to add PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals.  His corrected calcium is 9.7, and I would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.,5.  Acid base.

              " \"HISTORY:, This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.,BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:, The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.\",\n",

              " \"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics,In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient’s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

He has also been seen by me in the clinic in the last few weeks.  He was admitted on January 18, 2008, with recurrent malignant pleural effusion.  On the same day, he underwent VATS and thoracoscopic drainage of the pleural effusion with right pleural nodule biopsy, lysis of adhesions, and directed talc insufflation by Dr. X.  He was found to have 2.5L of bloody pleural effusions, some loculated pleural effusion, adhesions, and carcinomatosis in the parenchyma.  His hospital course here has been significant for dyspnea, requiring ICU stay.  He also had a chest tube, which was taken out few days ago.  He has also had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which he has been on amiodarone by cardiologist.  The biopsy from the pleural nodule done on the right on January 18, 2008, shows malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with mesothelioma.  Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells positive for calretinin and focally positive for D2-40, MOC-31.

              " 'REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the \"early stages of a likely dementia\" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient\\'s medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began \"as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor\\'s note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was \"too derogatory.\"  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated \"diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.\"  It concluded that \"results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient\\' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot \"like dragging.\"  Dr. X\\'s physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.

MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.

She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.

He has made multiple visits in the past. Today, the patient presents himself in severe respiratory distress. His wife states that since his recent admission of three weeks ago for treatment of pneumonia, he has not seemed to be able to recuperate, and has persistent complaints of shortness of breath.,Today, his symptoms worsened and she brought him to the emergency room. To the best of her knowledge, there has been no fever. He has persistent chronic cough, as always.

No white cells and 0-2 red cells.,Chest x-ray suboptimal in quality, but without obvious infiltrates, consolidation or pneumothorax.,CRITICAL CARE NOTE:,  Critical care one hour.,Shortly after the patient’s initial assessment, the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress. Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure. Given the patient’s white count and recent history of pneumonia, the possibility of recurrence of pneumonia is certainly there. Similarly, it would be difficult to rule out sepsis. Myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.,COORDINATION OF CARE:,  Dr. X was contacted from the emergency room and asked to assume the patient’s care in the Intensive Care Unit.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Respiratory failure secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:, The patient is to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.',\n",

In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.

If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.',\n",

              " \"REASON FOR EXAM:  This 60-year-old female who was found to have a solid indeterminate mass involving the inferior pole of the right kidney was referred for percutaneous biopsy under CT guidance at the request of Dr. X.,PROCEDURE:  The procedure risks and possible complications including, but not limited to severe hemorrhage which could result in emergent surgery, were explained to the patient.  The patient understood.  All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained.  With the patient in the prone position, noncontrasted CT localization images were obtained through the kidney.  Conscious sedation was utilized with the patient being monitored.  The patient was administered divided dose of Versed and fentanyl intravenously.,Following sterile preparation and local anesthesia to the posterior aspect of the right flank, an 18-gauge co-axial Temno-type needle was directed into the inferior pole right renal mass from the posterior oblique approach.  Two biopsy specimens were obtained and placed in 10% formalin solution.  CT documented needle placement.  Following the biopsy, there was active bleeding through the stylet, as well as a small hematoma about the inferior aspect of the right kidney posteriorly.  I placed several torpedo pledgets of Gelfoam through the co-axial sheath into the site of bleeding.  The bleeding stopped.  The co-axial sheath was then removed.  Bandage was applied.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  Postbiopsy CT images were then obtained.  The patient's hematoma appeared stable.  The patient was without complaints of pain or discomfort.  The patient was then sent to her room with plans of observing for approximately 4 hours and then to be discharged, as stable.  The patient was instructed to remain at bedrest for the remaining portions of the day at home and patient is to followup with Dr. Fieldstone for the results and follow-up care.,FINDINGS:  Initial noncontrasted CT localization images reveals the presence of an approximately 2.1 cm cortical mass involving the posterior aspect of the inferior pole of the right kidney.  Images obtained during the biopsy reveals the cutting portion of the biopsy needle to extend through the mass.  Images obtained following the biopsy reveals the development of a small hematoma posterior to the right kidney in its inferior pole adjacent to the mass.  There are small droplets of air within the hematoma.  No hydronephrosis is identified.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Percutaneous biopsy of inferior pole right renal mass under computed tomography guidance with specimen sent to laboratory in 10% formalin solution.,2.  Development of a small hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with active bleeding through the biopsy needle stopped by tract embolization with Gelfoam pledgets.\",\n",
              " 'REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient\\'s medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt \"just like the stroke.\"  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing \"mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,\" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient\\'s weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B\\'s and C\\'s in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only \"comes and goes.\",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test',\n",

Sleep has been poor, for multiple reasons.  She has obstructive sleep apnea, and has difficulties with a child who has insomnia related to medications that he takes.  The patient tends to feel irritable, and has crying spells.  She sometimes has problems with motivation.  She has problems with memory, and energy level is poor. Appetite has been poor, but without weight change.  Because of her frequent awakening, her CPAP machine monitor has indicated she is not using it enough, and Medicaid is threatening to refuse to pay for the machine.  She does not have suicidal thoughts.  ,The patient also has what she describes as going into a \"panic mode.\"  During these times, she feels as if her whole body is going to explode.  She has a hard time taking a deep breath, her heart rate goes up, blood pressure is measured as higher shortly afterward, and she gets a sense of impending doom.  These spells may last a couple of hours, but once lasted for about two day.  She does not get chest pain.  These attacks tend to be precipitated by bills that cannot be paid, or being on a \"time crunch.\" ,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  The patient\\'s nurse practitioner had started her on Cymbalta, up to 60 mg per day. This was helpful, but then another physician switched her to Wellbutrin in the hope that this would help her quit smoking.  Although she was able to cut down on tobacco usage, the depression has been more poorly controlled.  She has used Wellbutrin up to 200 mg b.i.d. and Cymbalta up to 60 mg per day, at different times.  At age 13, the patient cut her wrists because of issues with a boyfriend, and as she was being sutured she realized that this was a very stupid thing to do.  She has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes.  She did see a psychologist at age 16 briefly because of prior issues in her life, but she did not fully reveal information, and it was deemed that she did not need services.  She has not previously spoken with a psychiatrist, but has been seeing a therapist, Stephanie Kitchen, at this facility.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,Caffeine:  The patient has two or three drinks per day of tea or Diet Pepsi.,Tobacco:  She smokes about one pack of cigarettes per week since being on Wellbutrin, and prior to that time had been smoking one-half pack per day.  She is still committed to quitting.,Alcohol: Denied.,Illicit drugs:  Denied.  In her earlier years, someone once put some unknown drug in her milk, and she \"came to\" when she was dancing on the table in front of the school nurse.,MEDICAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,Constitutional:  See History of Present Illness.

              " 'HISTORY: , The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005.  She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved.  Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain.  She has been extensively worked up and treated for this.  MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal.  She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain.  In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated.  She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face.  By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg.  Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved.  However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg.  The face numbness has completely resolved.  Symptoms are mild.  She denies any previous similar episodes.  She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function.  There is no associated headache.,Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination.  Normal gait.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation.  She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot.  In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick.  She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: , Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.,NEEDLE EMG: , Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is normal.  There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy.  EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident.  This was normal.,Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year.  Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms.  Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results.',\n",

According to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001.  She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr.  A in August 2001.  It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.  Postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past.\",\n",

              " 'As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant.,Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk.  She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall.  She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests.  She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made.,The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved.  She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.,In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia.  She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing.  She was diagnosed as having \"overactive bladder\", but the cause of this was never determined.  She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit.  She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.,Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable \"stiffness\" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles.  Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others.  She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was \"not arthritis\", but no definite diagnosis was ever established.  She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal.  No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.,However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat.  She states from time-to-time she could \"barely walk\".  She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were \"walking on stilts\".  She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit.  She began to tire more easily when walking.,In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.,In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X.  He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine.  He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing.  After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis.  However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003.  Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.,The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex.  She continued on it for about six months.  However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it.  She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy.  So, she discontinued it also.,At that point in time, she decided to try a program of \"good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil\".,In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities.  She began to have to use a cane.  She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z.  She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak.  Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically.  However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.,She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005).  This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial.  However, it wore off once again.,A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to \"look better\".  She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.,Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets.  She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs.  She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.,She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.,The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability.  There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Essentially noncontributory.,ALLERGIES:,  The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN.

Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:,  The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet.  There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum.  There appear to be Dawson\\'s fingers.  The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.,Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05.  The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.,However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal.

The pain is described as crampy in the central part of her abdomen, and is associated with nausea and vomiting during the previous 24 hours. The patient denied passing any stool or gas per rectum for the previous 24 hours. She had been admitted recently to the hospital from December 19 to December 23, 2000, with a three-week history of fevers to 101.8, diaphoresis, anorexia, malaise and skin \"lumps\". She described a total of three \"lumps\". The first one started as a pin-sized lesion that grew up and then disappeared, the other two didn\\'t resolve. They were described as \"erythematous nodular lesions on the extensor surface of the left arm.\" A punch biopsy was obtained from these skin lesions, showing deep dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue that contained \"multiple granulomas composed of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without caseating necrosis\". However, one granuloma in the deep dermis, showed a hint of central necrosis. Special stains for acid - fast bacilli and fungi were reported as negative. No atypia or malignancy was noted. A CT scan of the chest was obtained on December 19, 2000 and showed numerous masses with spiculated borders bilaterally, predominately in the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes.

He has a PSA of 3.1, with a prostate gland size of 41 grams.  This was initially found on rectal examination with a nodule on the right side of the prostate, showing enlargement relative to the left.  He has undergone evaluation with a bone scan that showed a right parietal lesion uptake and was seen by Dr. XXX and ultimately underwent an open biopsy that was not malignant.

              " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.  The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.,HEENT:  PERRLA.

Bowel sounds present.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.,PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.,LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.\",\n",

Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.  ,OBJECTIVE: , The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15.  Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact.  Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities.  Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception.  Cerebellar exam is intact.  Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes.  Speech is appropriate.  Judgment is intact.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme.  We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing.  Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma.  The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor.  He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night.  He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning.  He has undergone vocational rehab assessment.',\n",
              " 'SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  The patient is a very pleasant 44-year-old white female quite obese.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  122/70.

At least 2+ pedal edema.  The right leg just has a trace of edema.  She has pain in her low back with range of motion.  She has a lot of pain in her left shoulder with range of motion.  It is hard for her to get her hand behind her back.  She cannot get it up behind her head.  She has pain in the anterior left shoulder in that area.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Multiple problems including left leg swelling.,2.  History of leukocytosis.,3.  Joint pain involving the left shoulder, probably impingement syndrome.,4.  Low back pain, chronic with obesity.,5.  Obesity.,6.  Frequency with urination.,7.  Tobacco abuse.,PLAN:,1.  I will schedule for a venous Doppler of the left leg and will have her come back in the morning for a CBC and a metabolic panel.  We will start her on Detrol 0.4 mg one daily and also started on Mobic 15 mg per day.,2.  Elevate her leg as much as possible and wear support hose if possible.  Keep her foot up during the day.  We will see her back in two weeks.  We will have the results of the Doppler, the lab work and see how she is doing with the Detrol and the joint pain.  If her shoulder pain is not any better, we probably should refer her on over to orthopedist.  We did do x-rays of her shoulder today that did not show anything remarkable.  See her in two weeks or p.r.n.',\n",

The patient\\'s sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient\\'s previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law\\'s report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient\\'s previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often \"no.\"  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient\\'s overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient\\'s severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient\\'s deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded \"no\" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient\\'s sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient\\'s visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered \"no\" to all \"yes/no\" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated \"I can\\'t\".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient\\'s responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient\\'s communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient\\'s functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient\\'s speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple \"yes/no\" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.',\n",

She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place.  She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.  She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left.  She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up.  She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches.

Weight is 257 pounds.  Pain scale is 7.,GENERAL:  This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination.  It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw.  She is obese.,HEENT:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally.  There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region.  There are no palpable cervical nodes.,NECK:  Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,HEART:  Heart sounds are distant.  There are no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:,MENTAL STATUS:  She is alert and oriented x3.  Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential.  She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.,MOTOR:  This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity.  There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout.  Her tone is normal throughout.,SENSORY:  She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg.  She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.,COORDINATION:  There is no obvious dysmetria.,GAIT:  She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker.

Toes are equivocal.,OTHER:  Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, \"Oh my back, oh my back\", and was unable to complete the maneuver.  Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology.  Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.,We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert.',\n",

After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.  Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.\",\n",
              " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check.  The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work.  She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.\",\n",

There has been no nausea associated with the headaches.  The patient does note that when she speaks on the phone, the left ear has \"weird sounds.\"  She feels a general fullness in the left ear.  She does note pulsation sounds within that left ear only.  This began on February 17th according to the patient.  The patient reports that the ear pulsations began following an air flight to Iowa where she was visiting family.  The patient does admit that the pulsations in the ears seem to be somewhat better over the past few weeks.  Interestingly, there has been no significant drop or change in her hearing.  She does report she has had dizzy episodes in the past with nausea, being off balance at times.  It is not associated with the pulsations in the ear.  She does admit the pulsations will tend to come and go and there had been periods where the pulsations have completely cleared in the ear.  She is denying any vision changes.  The headaches are listed as moderate to severe in intensity on average about three to four times per week.  She has been taking Tylenol and Excedrin to try to control the headaches and that seems to be helping somewhat.

I have also ordered a carotid ultrasound study as part of the workup and evaluation.  She has had a recent CAT scan of the brain though this was without contrast.  It did reveal previous mastoidectomy, left temporal bone, but no other mass noted.  I have started her on Nasacort AQ nasal spray one spray each nostril daily as this is eustachian tube related.  Hearing protection devices should be used at all times as well.  I did counsel the patient if she has any upcoming airplane trips to use nasal decongestant or topical nasal decongestant spray prior to boarding the plane, and also using the airplane ear plugs as these can be effective at helping to prevent eustachian tube issues.  I am going to recheck her in three weeks.  If the pulsatile tinnitus at that time is not clear, we have discussed other treatment options including myringotomy or ear tube placement, which could be done here in the office.  She will be scheduled for a audio and tympanogram to be done as well prior to that procedure.',\n",

The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.

Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,OBJECTIVE: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,ASSESSMENT,ORAL STAGE:,  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.

During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded.  His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode.  He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable.  It was suggested at that time that he get a CT angiogram since he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker.  He has had no further similar events.  He denies any lesions or other visual change, focal weakness or sensory change, headaches, gait change or other neurological problem.,He also reports that he has been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis based on some mild difficulty arising from a chair for which an outside physician ordered a CT of his L-spine that reportedly showed lumbar stenosis.  The question has arisen as to whether he should have a CT myelogram to further evaluate this process.

TIA.  The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation.  Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection.  He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system.  He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued.  Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup.  The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time.,2.  Lumbar stenosis.  His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability.

The patient has a consult pending with the oncologist to see what her PET scan show.  There is a renal consult pending.  I am going to have her get a total abdominal ultrasound to see if there is any evidence of liver metastasis and also to assess her kidneys.  Her laboratory studies will be followed.  Based upon the patient's medical condition and including her laboratory studies including a platelet count, we talked about EGD versus upper GI workup per upper GI symptoms.  I discussed informed consent for EGD.  I discussed the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  The risks reviewed included, but were not limited to an allergic reaction or side effect to medicines, cardiopulmonary complications, bleeding, infection, perforation, and needing to get admitted for antibiotics or blood transfusion or surgery.  The patient voices her understanding of the above.  She wants to think about what she wants to do.  Overall, this is a very ill patient with multiorgan involvement.\",\n",
              " \"HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.,The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety.\",\n",

He did not note any immediate reaction.  Since that time, he has noted some increasing redness and swelling to his left hand, but he denies any generalized symptoms such as itching, hives, or shortness of breath.  He denies any sensation of tongue swelling or difficulty swallowing.,The patient states he was stung approximately one month ago without any serious reaction.  He did windup taking Benadryl at that time.  He has not taken anything today for his symptoms, but he is on hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol for hypertension as well as a baby aspirin each day.,ALLERGIES: , HE DOES HAVE MEDICATION INTOLERANCES TO SULFA DRUGS (HEADACHE), MORPHINE (NAUSEA AND VOMITING), AND TORADOL (ULCER).,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient is married and is a nonsmoker and lives with his wife, who is here with him.,Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp and vital signs are all within normal limits.,GENERAL:  In general, the patient is an elderly white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.,HEENT:  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.

There was some slight edema of the fourth digit, on which he still is wearing his wedding band.  The right hand shows no reaction.  The right knee is not swollen either.,The left fourth digit was wrapped in a rubber tourniquet to express the edema and using some Surgilube, I was able to remove his wedding band without any difficulty.  Patient was given Claritin 10 mg orally for what appears to be a simple local reaction to an insect sting.  I did explain to him that his swelling and redness may progress over the next few days.,ASSESSMENT: , Local reaction secondary to insect sting.,PLAN: , The patient was reassured that this is not a serious reaction to an insect sting and he should not progress to such a reaction.  I did urge him to use Claritin 10 mg once daily until the redness and swelling has gone.  I did explain that the swelling may worsen over the next two to three days, it may produce a large local reaction, but that anti-histamines were still the mainstay of therapy for such a reaction.  If he is not improved in the next four days, follow up with his PCP for a re-exam.',\n",

He has had several cases of this in the past and he says that is usually takes quite awhile for him to get over it; he said that the last time he was here he got a steroid injection by Dr. Blackman; it looked like it was Depo-Medrol 80 mg.  He said that it worked fairly well, although it seemed to still take awhile to get rid of it.  He has been using over-the-counter Benadryl as well as cortisone cream on the areas of the rash and having a little bit of improvement, but this last weekend he must have gotten into some more poison ivy because he has got another outbreak along his chest, legs, arms and back.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Temperature is 99.2.  His weight is 207 pounds.,Skin:  Examination reveals a raised, maculopapular rash in kind of a linear pattern over his arms, legs and chest area which are consistent with a poison ivy or a poison oak.,ASSESSMENT AND ,PLAN:,  Poison ivy.  Plan would be Solu-Medrol 125 mg IM X 1.  Continue over-the-counter Benadryl or Rx allergy medicine that he was given the last time he was here, which is a one-a-day allergy medicine; he can not exactly remember what it is, which would also be fine rather than the over-the-counter Benadryl if he would like to use that instead.',\n",

Options such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, and shockwave lithotripsy were discussed.  The patient has a pretty enlarged stone.  Failure of the procedure if the stone is significantly impacted into the ureteral wall was discussed.  The patient understood that the success of the surgery may be or may not be 100%, that she may require shockwave lithotripsy if we are unable to get the entire stone out in one sitting.  The patient understood all the risk, benefits of the procedure and wanted to proceed.  Need for stent was also discussed with the patient.  The patient will be scheduled for surgery tomorrow.  Plan for continuation of the antibiotics, obtain urinalysis and culture, and plan for KUB to evaluate for the exact location of the stone prior to surgery tomorrow.\",\n",

The patient is an 86-year-old female with an L5 compression fracture.,The patient has a history of back and buttock pain for some time.  She was found to have an L5 compression fracture.  She was treated conservatively over several months, but did not improve.  Unfortunately, she has continued to have significant ongoing back pain and recent CT scan has shown a sclerosis with some healing of her L5 compression fracture, but without complete healing.  The patient has had continued pain and at this time, is felt to be a candidate for kyphoplasty.,She denies bowel or bladder incontinence.  She does complain of back pain.  She has been wearing a back brace and corset.  She does not have weakness.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  The patient has a history of multiple medical problems including hypothyroidism, hypertension, and gallbladder difficulties.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  She has had multiple previous surgeries including bowel surgery, hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and appendectomy.

HEART:  Sounds are regular.  ABDOMEN:  She has a protuberant abdomen.  She has tenderness to palpation in the lumbosacral area.  Sciatic notch tenderness is not present.  Straight leg raise testing evokes back pain.  NEUROLOGICAL:  She is awake, alert, and oriented.  Speech is intact.  Comprehension is normal.  Strength is intact in the upper extremities.  She has giveaway strength in the lower extremities.  Reflexes are diminished at the knees and ankles.  Gait is otherwise normal.,DATA REVIEWED: , Plain studies of the lumbar spine show an L5 compression fracture.  A CT scan has shown some healing of this fracture.  She has degenerative change at the L4-L5 level with a very slight spondylolisthesis at this level.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , The patient is a woman with a history of longstanding back, buttock, and leg pain.  She has a documented L5 compression fracture, which has not healed despite appropriate conservative treatments.  At this point, I believe the patient is a good candidate for L5 kyphoplasty.  I have discussed the procedure with her and I have reviewed with her and her family risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery.  Risks of surgery including but not limited to bleeding, infection, stroke, paralysis, death, failure to improve, spinal fluid leak, need for further surgery, cement extravasation, failure to improve her pain, and other potential complications have all been discussed.

              " 'REASON FOR VISIT: , This is a cosmetic consultation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a very pleasant 34-year-old white female who is a nurse in the operating room.  She knows me through the operating room and has asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her.  She is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery.  She has recently had some neck surgery for a re-fusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this.  Her current desires are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen, and she came to me mostly because I offer transumbilical breast augmentation.  Her breasts are reportedly healthy without any significant problems.  Her weight is currently stable.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: ,  Negative.  Past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 02/05 and in 09/06.  She has had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for Huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father.  Her brother has an aneurysm.  She does occasionally smoke and has been trying to quit recently.  She is currently smoking about a pack a day.  She drinks about once a week.  She is currently a registered nurse, circulator, and scrub technician in the operating room at Hopkins.  She has no children.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,A 12-system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain, mostly around her neck and thoracic region.  She does have occasional rash on her chest and problems with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain.  She has considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability.  Her last mammogram was in 2000.  She has a size 38C breast.,MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are 5 mg of methadone three times a day and amitriptyline at night as needed.,ALLERGIES: , None.,FINDINGS: , On exam today, the patient has good posture, good physique, good skin tone.  She is tanned.  Her lower abdomen has some excess adiposity.  There is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin.  Her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation.  There was no piercing in that region.  Her breasts are C shaped.  They are not ptotic.  They have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity.  She has no masses or lesions noted.  The nipples are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age.  Her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed.  Hopefully, our scars would be similar to this.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Hypomastia.  I think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely.  This would make her fill out her clothes much better, and I think transumbilical technique in her is a good option.  I have discussed with her the other treatment options, and she does not want scars around her breasts if at all possible.  I think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone.  I think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely.  I am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity, and I will discuss with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem, she may need a mini tummy tuck.  I do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she gets after the adiposity is removed.  I will try to set this up in the near future.  I will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure.  Due to her neck issues, we may not be able to perform her surgery but I will check with Dr. X to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused.',\n",

              " \"HISTORY: , The patient is a 67-year-old female, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety.  At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my services at this time due to a plateau in her progress.  Numerous home activities were recommended to allow her to continue to make progress at home.\"]"

It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever\",\n",

The RDW was 18.5, and the rest of the values were all within normal limits and unremarkable.  Chemistry had a sodium of 134, a glucose of 132, calcium is 8.2, and rest of the values are unremarkable.  Alkaline phosphatase was 770 and albumin was 2.4.  Rest of the values all are within normal limits of the LFTs.  Urinalysis was grossly bloody with a large amount of blood and greater than 50 rbc's.  The patient also had greater than 300 of the protein reading, moderate leukocytes, 30-50 white blood cells, but no bacteria were seen.  Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: , The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect.  The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.  The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.,DIAGNOSES,1.  HEMATURIA.,2.  PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.,3.  SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.,4.  URINARY OBSTRUCTION.,CONDITION ON DISPOSITION:  ,Fair, but improved.,DISPOSITION: , To home with his son.,PLAN: , We will have the patient follow up with Dr. X in his office in 2 days for reevaluation.  The patient was given a prescription for Levaquin and Phenergan tablets to take home with him tonight.  The patient was encouraged to drink extra water.  The patient was given discharge instructions on hematuria and asked to return to the emergency room should he have any worsening of his condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 71-year-old female who I am seeing for the first time.  She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for the last 6 years.  She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.  She says when this started she had significant joint pains and was unable to walk.  She had pain in the hands and feet.  Currently, she has no pain in any of her joints.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Denies photosensitivity, oral or nasal ulcer, seizure, psychosis, and skin rashes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and left BKA.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  BP 130/70, heart rate 80, and respiratory rate 14.,HEENT:  EOMI.

No organomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  No edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Deferred.,ARTICULAR:  She has swelling of bilateral wrists, but no significant tenderness.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs in chart was reviewed.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  A 71-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, on longstanding prednisone.  She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.\n",

            "Note: Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.\n",

            "Note: REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Left hip fracture.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a pleasant 53-year-old female with a known history of sciatica, apparently presented to the emergency room due to severe pain in the left lower extremity and unable to bear weight.  History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  She is divorced with 2 children.  She lives with her son.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is well developed, well nourished in mild distress secondary to left lower extremity and back pain.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination of the left lower extremity, there is presence of apparent shortening and external rotation deformity.  Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.,Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  I will continue to follow up.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left.  The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well.  The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago.  She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot.  The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart.  Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds.  She has palpable pulses.  Neurologic sensation is intact.  Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy.  There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement.  She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right.  Gait analysis:  The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet.,X-RAY INTERPRETATION:,  X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy.  Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle.  No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted.  Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot.,2.  Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet.,PLAN/TREATMENT:,1.  Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment.  The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy  at the second metatarsal.  Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications.  The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well.,2.  The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date.,3.  All questions were answered.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Left breast cancer.,HISTORY:,  The patient is a 57-year-old female, who I initially saw in the office on 12/27/07, as a referral from the Tomball Breast Center.  On 12/21/07, the patient underwent image-guided needle core biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion at the 7 o'clock position of the left breast (inferomedial).  The biopsy returned showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma high histologic grade.  The patient stated that she had recently felt and her physician had felt a palpable mass in that area prior to her breast imaging.  She prior to that area, denied any complaints.  She had no nipple discharge.  No trauma history.  She has had been on no estrogen supplementation.  She has had no other personal history of breast cancer.  Her family history is positive for her mother having breast cancer at age 48.  The patient has had no children and no pregnancies.  She denies any change in the right breast.  Subsequent to the office visit and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer, she has had medical oncology consultation with Dr. X and radiation oncology consultation with Dr. Y.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and Dr. Y, who are both in agreement with proceeding with surgery prior to adjuvant therapy.  The patient's metastatic workup has otherwise been negative with MRI scan and CT scanning.  The MRI scan showed some close involvement possibly involving the left pectoralis muscle, although thought to also possibly represent biopsy artifact.  CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen is negative for metastatic disease.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Previous surgery is history of benign breast biopsy in 1972, laparotomy in 1981, 1982, and 1984, right oophorectomy in 1984, and ganglion cyst removal of the hand in 1987.,MEDICATIONS:,  She is currently on omeprazole for reflux and indigestion.,ALLERGIES:,  SHE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.  Positive for restless leg syndrome.  Negative for any unexplained weight loss and no change in bowel or bladder habits.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Positive for breast cancer in her mother and also mesothelioma from possible asbestosis or asbestos exposure.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient works as a school teacher and teaching high school.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  The patient is a white female, alert and oriented x 3, appears her stated age of 57.,HEENT:  Head is atraumatic and normocephalic.  Sclerae are anicteric.,NECK:  Supple.,CHEST:  Clear.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,BREASTS:  Exam reveals an approximately 1.5 cm relatively mobile focal palpable mass in the inferomedial left breast at the 7 o'clock position, which clinically is not fixed to the underlying pectoralis muscle.  There are no nipple retractions.  No skin dimpling.  There is some, at the time of the office visit, ecchymosis from recent biopsy.  There is no axillary adenopathy.  The remainder of the left breast is without abnormality.  The right breast is without abnormality.  The axillary areas are negative for adenopathy bilaterally.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without masses.  No gross organomegaly.  No CVA or flank tenderness.,EXTREMITIES:  Grossly neurovascularly intact.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I have discussed with the patient in detail about the diagnosis of breast cancer and the surgical options, and medical oncologist has discussed with her issues about adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection.  The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient.  The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained.  Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained.  The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers.  She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding.  I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Mental status changes after a fall.,HISTORY: , Ms. ABC is a 76-year-old female with Alzheimer's, apparently is normally very talkative, active, independent, but with advanced Alzheimer's.  Apparently, she tripped backwards hitting her head on a wheelchair and, had although no loss consciousness, had altered mental status changes.  She was very confused, incomprehensible speech, and was not responding appropriately.  She was transported here stable, with no significant changes.  She ultimately upon arrival here was unchanged in that she was not responding appropriately.  She would have garbled speech, somewhat inappropriate at times, and unable to follow commands.  No other history was able to be obtained.  All pertinent history is documented within the records.  Physical examination also documented in the records, essentially as above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , HEENT:  Without any obvious signs of trauma.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  Extraocular movements are difficult to assess with her eyes closed, but she will open to voice.  TMs, canals are normal without any signs of hemotympanum.  Nasal mucosa and oropharynx are normal.,NECK:  Nontender, full range of motion, was not examined initially, a collar was placed.,HEART:  Regular.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CHEST/BACK/ABDOMEN:  Without trauma.,SKIN:  With multiple excoriations from scratching and itching.,NEUROLOGIC:  Otherwise she has good sensation, withdrawals to pain.  When lifting the arm, she will hold them up and draw, let them down slowly.  With movement of the legs, she did straighten them back out slowly.  DTRs were intact and equal bilaterally.  Otherwise, the remainder of the examination was unable to be done because of patient's non-cooperation and mental status change.,LABORATORY DATA: , CT scan of the head was negative as was cervical spine.  She has a history of being on Coumadin.  Her INR is 1.92, CBC was with a white count of 3.8, 50% neutrophils, 8% bands.  CMP did note a potassium, which was elevated at 5.9, troponin was normal, mag is 2.5, valproic acid level 24.3.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems who has sustained a head injury with mental status changes that on repeat examination now at approximately 1930 hours, has completely resolved.  It is likely she sustained a concussion with postconcussive symptoms and syndrome that has resolved.  At this time, she has some other abnormalities in her lab work and I recommend she be admitted for observation and further investigation.  I have discussed this with her son, he agrees.  Otherwise, she has improved significantly.  The patient was discussed with XYZ, who will admit the patient for further evaluation and treatment.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 75-year-old female who comes in today with concerns of having a stroke.  She states she feels like she has something in her throat.  She started with some dizziness this morning and some left hand and left jaw numbness.  She said that she apparently had something about three weeks ago where she was dizzy and ended up falling down and she saw Dr. XYZ for that who gave her some Antivert.  She said that today though she woke up in the middle of the night and her left hand was numb and she was having numbness on the left side of her face, as well as the left side of her neck.  She said she had an earache a day or so ago.  She has not had any cold symptoms.,ALLERGIES:,  Demerol and codeine.,MEDICATIONS: , Lotensin, Lopid, metoprolol, and Darvocet.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  The patient says that she feels little bit nauseated at times.  She denies chest pain or shortness of breath and again feels like she has something in her throat.  She has been able to swallow liquids okay.  She said that she did brush her teeth this morning and did not have any fluid dripping out of her mouth.  She does say that she occasionally has numbness in her left hand prior to today.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  She is awake and alert, no acute distress.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  175/86.  Temperature:  She is afebrile.  Pulse:  78.  Respiratory rate:  20.  O2 sat:  93% on room air.,HEENT:  Her TMs are normal bilaterally.  Posterior pharynx is unremarkable.  It should be noted that her uvula did not deviate and neither did her tongue.  When she smiles though she has some drooping of the left side of her face, as well as some mild nasolabial fold flattening.,Neck:  Without adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids pulses are brisk without bruits.,Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.,Extremities:  Her muscle strength is symmetrical and intact bilaterally.  DTRs are 2+/4+ bilaterally and muscle strength is intact in the upper extremities.  She has a positive Tinel’s sign on her left wrist.,Neurological:  I also took monofilament and she could sense it easily when testing her sensation on her face.,ASSESSMENT:,  Bell’s Palsy.,PLAN:,  We did get an EKG showed some ST segment changes anterolaterally.  The only EKG I have here is from 1998 and she actually had bypass in 1999, but there certainly does not appear to be anything acute on his EKG.  I assured her that it does not look like she has a stroke.  If she wants to prevent a stroke, obviously quitting her smoking would help.  It should be noted she also takes Synthroid and Zocor.  We are going to give her Valtrex 1 g t.i.d. for seven days and then if she starts noticing any other drooping or worsening of her symptoms on the left side of her face, she needs to come back, but I will not start her on steroids at this time, which she agreed with.\n",

When questioned further, she described shortness of breath primarily with ambulation.  She denies chest pain.  She denies cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and wheeze.  She denies syncope, presyncope, or palpitations.  Her symptoms are fairly longstanding but have been worsening as of late.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  She has had a fairly extensive past medical history but is a somewhat poor historian and is unable to provide details about her history.  She states that she has underlying history of heart disease but is not able to elaborate to any significant extent.

We will have the patient sign a release of records so that we can review her previous history.  Consider setting up for a stress test.,2.  Hypertension, blood pressure is acceptable today.  I am not certain as to what, if the patient’s is on any antihypertensive agents.  We will need to have her call us what the names of her medications, so we can see exactly what she is taking.,3.  History of diabetes.  Again, not certain as to whether the patient is taking anything for this particular problem when she last had a hemoglobin A1C.

            "Note: REASON FOR ADMISSION:,  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.,HISTORY: , A very pleasant 63-year-old hypertensive, nondiabetic, African-American female with a history of peritoneal mesothelioma.  The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.  No suspicious osseous lesions were noted.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Norco 10 per 325 one to two p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily, Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea, lorazepam 0.5 mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety, Ventolin HFA 2 puffs q.6h. p.r.n., Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, Cymbalta 60 mg p.o. daily, and Restoril 30 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.,ALLERGIES: , THE PATIENT STATES THAT ON OCCASION LORAZEPAM DOSE PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS, AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY TOLERATING ATIVAN.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's height is 165 cm, weight is 77 kg.  BSA is 1.8 sq m.  The vital signs reveal blood pressure to be 158/75, heart rate 61 per minute with a regular sinus rhythm, temperature of 96.6 degrees, respiratory rate 18 with an SpO2 of 100% on room air.,GENERAL:  She is normally developed; well nourished; very cooperative; oriented to person, place, and time; and in no distress at this time.  She is anicteric.,HEENT:  EOM is full.  Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Disc margins are unremarkable as are the ocular fields.  Mouth and pharynx within normal limits.  The TMs are glistening bilaterally.  External auditory canals are unremarkable.,NECK:  Supple, nontender without adenopathy.  Trachea is midline.  There are no bruits nor is there jugular venous distention.,CHEST:  Clear to percussion and auscultation bilaterally.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, or rub.,BREASTS:  Unremarkable.,ABDOMEN:  Slightly protuberant.  Bowel tones are present and normal.  She has no palpable mass, and there is no hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  Within normal limits.,NEUROLOGICAL:  Nonfocal.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION,1.  Intraperitoneal mesothelioma, partial remission, as noted by CT scan of the abdomen.,2.  Presumed left lower pole kidney hemorrhagic cyst.,3.  History of hypertension.,4.  Type 1 bipolar disease.,PLAN: , The patient will have appropriate laboratory studies done.  A left renal ultrasound is requested to further delineate the possible hemorrhagic cyst in the lower left pole of the left kidney.  Interventional radiology will access for ports in the abdomen.  She will receive chemotherapy intraperitoneally.  The plan will be to use intraperitoneal Taxol.\n",

CPK is already over 1000. There is ST elevation in leads II and aVF, as well as a Q wave. The chest pain is now gone, mild residual shortness of breath, no orthopnea. Cardiac monitor shows resolution of ST elevation lead III.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, Following sterile prep and drape of the right groin, installation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was percutaneously entered and 6-French sheath inserted. ACT approximately 165 seconds on heparin. Borderline hypotension 250 mL fluid bolus given and nitroglycerin patch removed. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricular pressures and left ventriculography. Left pullback pressure. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. He tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit in stable condition.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevated post A-wave at 25 mm of Mercury with no aortic valve systolic gradient on pullback.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is unremarkable. The left anterior descending has 30 to 40% narrowing with tortuosity in its proximal portion, patent first septal perforator branch. The first diagonal branch is a 2 mm vessel with a 90% ostial stenosis. The second diagonal branch is unremarkable, as are the tiny distal diagonal branches. The intermediate branch is a small, normal vessel. The ostial non-dominant circumflex has some contrast thinning, but no stenosis, normal obtuse marginal branch, and small AV sulcus circumflex branch.,II. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large, dominant vessel which gives off large posterior descending and posterolateral left ventricular branches. There are luminal irregularities, less than 25%, within the proximal to mid vessel. Some contrast thinning is present in the distal RCA just before the bifurcation into posterior descending and posterolateral branches. A 25%, smooth narrowing at the origin of the posterior descending branch. Posterolateral branch is unremarkable and quite large, with secondary and tertiary branches.,III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is normal in size. Ejection fraction estimated at 40 to 45%. No mitral regurgitation.

A 61-year-old white male with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, diagnosed in 2001, status post autologous transplant with BEAM regimen in 04/02 followed by relapse.,2.  Allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant from match-related brother and the patient is 53 months out from transplant.,3.  Graft versus host disease involving GI tracts, skin, and liver presently off immunosuppression.,4.  Diabetes.,5.  Bipolar disorder.,6.  Chronic muscle aches.,7.  Chronic lower extremity edema.,8.  ECOG performance status 1.,INTERIM HISTORY: , The patient comes to the clinic today for followup.  I am seeing him once every 4 to 8 weeks.  He is off of all immunosuppression.  He does have mild chronic GVHD but not enough to warrant any therapy and the disease has been under control and he is 4-1/2-years posttransplant.,He has multiple complaints.  He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.  He may have mild iron deficiency, but he is fatigued and has several complaints related to his level of activity.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Paxil 40 mg once daily.,2.  Cozaar.,3.  Xanax 1 mg four times a day.,4.  Prozac 20 mg a day.,5.  Lasix 40 mg a day.,6.  Potassium 10 mEq a day.,7.  Mirapex two tablets every night.,8.  Allegra 60 mg twice a day.,9.  Avandamet 4/1000 mg daily.,10.  Nexium 20 mg a day.,11.  NovoLog 25/50.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Fatigue, occasional rectal bleeding, and obesity.  Other systems were reviewed and were found to be unremarkable.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Today revealed that temperature 35.8, blood pressure 120/49, pulse 85, and respirations 18.  HEENT:  Oral cavity, no mucositis.  NECK:  No nodes.  AXILLA:  No nodes.  LUNGS:  Clear.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  No palpable masses.  Morbid obesity.

Normal alkaline phosphatase 203, AST 58, and ALT 31.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1.  The patient with mantle cell lymphoma who is 4-1/2 years post allotransplant.  He is without evidence of disease at the present time.  Since he is 4-1/2 years posttransplant, I do not plan to scan him or obtain chimerisms unless there is reason to.,2.  He is slightly anemic, may be iron deficient.  He has had recurrent rectal bleeding.  I told him to take multivitamin with iron and see how that helps the anemia.,3.  Regarding the hematochezia, he had an endoscopy.  I reviewed the results from the previous endoscopy.  It appears that he has polyps, but there is no evidence of graft versus host disease.,4.  Regarding the fatigue, I just reassured him that he should increase his activity level, but I am not sure how realistic that is going to be.,5.  He is followed for his diabetes by his internist.,6.  If he should have any fever or anything suggestive of infection, I advised him to call me.  I will see him back in about 2 months from now.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 43-year-old male who was recently discharged from our care on the 1/13/06 when he presented for shortness of breath. He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.,MEDICATIONS:, Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.,HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.,NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.,CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.,ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.,EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.,PLAN:, The patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT: , \"I want my colostomy reversed.\",HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mr. A is a pleasant 43-year-old African-American male who presents to our clinic for a colostomy reversal as well as repair of an incisional hernia.  The patient states that in November 2007, he presented to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp left lower quadrant pain and was emergently taken to Surgery where he woke up with a \"bag.\"  According to some notes that were faxed to our office from the surgeon in High Point who performed his initial surgery, Dr. X, the patient had diverticulitis with perforated sigmoid colon, and underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch.  The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic.  The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November.  He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X.  Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort.  He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,2.  Question of hypertension.,3.  Status post sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November 2007 at High Point Regional.,4.

The stoma is pink, protuberant, and productive.  The patient also has a midline incisional hernia approximately 6 cm in diameter.  It is reducible.  Otherwise, there are no further hernias or masses noted.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,This is a 43-year-old gentleman who underwent what sounds like a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November of 2007 secondary to perforated colon from diverticulitis.  The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia.  I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery.  He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment.  I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump.  He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point.  This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today.  They were in agreement with this plan.  We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag.  To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this.,\n",

The patient stated that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed with subsequent left-sided weakness.  The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  The patient also complains of difficulty with word retrieval and slurring of speech.  The patient denies any difficulty with swallowing at this time.,OBJECTIVE:  ,Portions of the cognitive linguistic quick test was administered.  An oral mechanism exam was performed.  A motor speech protocol was completed.,The cognitive linguistic subtests of recalling personal facts, symbol cancellation, confrontational naming, clock drawing, story retelling, generative naming, design and memory, and completion of mazes was administered.,The patient was 100% accurate with recalling personal facts, completion of the symbol cancellation tasks, and with confrontational naming.  She had no difficulty with the clock drawing task; however, she has considerable hand tremors, which makes writing difficult.  In the storytelling task, she scored within normal limits.  She was also within normal limits for generative naming.  She did have difficulty with the design, memory, and mazes subtests.  She was unable to complete the second maze during the allotted time.  The design generation subtest was also completed.  She was able to draw four unique designs, and toward the end of the tasks was no longer able to recall the stated direction.,ORAL MECHANISM EXAMINATION:,  The patient has mild left facial droop with decreased nasolabial fold.  Tongue is at midline, and lingual range of motion and strength are within functional limit.  The patient does complain of biting her tongue on occasion, but denied biting the inside of her cheeks.  Her AMRs are judged to be within functional limit.  Her rate of speech is decreased with a monotonous vocal quality.  The decreased rate may be a compensation for decreased word retrieval ability.  The patient's speech is judged to be 100% intelligible without background noise.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient has mild cognitive linguistic deficits in the areas of higher level cognitive function seen in mental flexibility, memory, and executive function.,PLAN OF CARE:,  Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for four weeks to include cognitive linguistic treatment.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (THREE WEEKS):,1.  The patient will complete deductive reasoning and mental flexibility tasks with greater than 90% accuracy, independently.,2.  The patient will complete perspective memory test with 100% accuracy using compensatory strategy.,3.  The patient will complete visual perceptual activities, which focus on scanning, flexibility, and problem solving with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will listen to and/or read a lengthy narrative and be able to recall at least 6 details after a 15-minute delay, independently.,PATIENT'S GOAL:  ,To improve functional independence and cognitive abilities.,LONG-TERM GOAL (FOUR WEEKS):  ,Functional cognitive linguistic abilities to improve safety and independence at home and to decrease burden of care on caregiver.,\n",

The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,1.  The overall quality of the scan was good.,2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.,3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size.,4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.,CONCLUSIONS:,1.  Good exercise tolerance.,2.  Less than adequate cardiac stress.

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient is here for two-month followup.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian female.  She has hypertension.  She has had no difficulties with chest pain.  She has some shortness of breath only at walking up the stairs.  She has occasional lightheadedness only if she bends over then stands up quickly.  She has had no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  She does have severe osteoarthritis of the left knee and is likely going to undergo total knee replacement with Dr. XYZ in January of this coming year.  The patient is wanting to lose weight before her surgery.  She is concerned about possible coronary disease or stroke risk.  She has not had any symptoms of cardiac disease other than some shortness of breath with exertion, which she states has been fairly stable.  She has had fairly normal lipid panel, last being checked on 11/26/2003.  Cholesterol was 194, triglycerides 118, HDL 41, and LDL 129.  The patient is a nonsmoker.  Her fasting glucose in November 2003 was within normal limits at 94.  Her fasting insulin level was normal.  Repeat nonfasting glucose was 109 on 06/22/2004.  She does not have history of diabetes.  She does not exercise regularly and is not able to because of knee pain.  She also has had difficulties with low back pain.  X-ray of the low back did show a mild compression fracture of L1.  She has had no falls that would contribute to a compression fracture.  She has had a normal DEXA scan on 11/07/2003 that does not really correlate with having a compression fracture of the lumbar spine; however, it is possible that arthritis could contribute to falsely high bone density reading on DEXA scan.  She is wanting to consider treatment for prevention of further compression fractures and possible osteoporosis.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg a day, Prozac 20 mg a day, Vioxx 25 mg a day, vitamin C 250 mg daily, vitamin E three to four tablets daily, calcium with D 1500 mg daily, multivitamin daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, Monopril 40 mg daily, Celexa p.r.n.,ALLERGIES:  ,Bactrim, which causes nausea and vomiting, and adhesive tape.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Hypertension.,2.  Depression.,3.  Myofascitis of the feet.,4.  Severe osteoarthritis of the knee.,5.  Removal of the melanoma from the right thigh in 1984.,6.  Breast biopsy in January of 1997, which was benign.,7.  History of Holter monitor showing ectopic beat.  Echocardiogram was normal.  These were in 1998.,8.  Compression fracture of L1, unknown cause.  She had had no injury.  Interestingly, DEXA scan was normal 11/07/2003, which is somewhat conflicting.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is married.  She is a nonsmoker and nondrinker.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  As per the HPI.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished, pleasant Caucasian female, who is overweight.,Vital signs:  Weight:  Refused.  Blood pressure:  148/82, on recheck by myself with a large cuff, it was 125/60.  Pulse:  64.  Respirations:  20.  Temperature:  96.3.,Neck:  Supple.  Carotids are silent.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Cardiovascular:  Revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, S3, or S4.,Extremities:  Revealed no edema.,Neurologic:  Grossly intact.,RADIOLOGY:  EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm, rate 61, borderline first degree AV block, and poor R-wave progression in the anterior leads.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Hypertension, well controlled.,2.  Family history of cerebrovascular accident.,3.  Compression fracture of L1, mild.,4.  Osteoarthritis of the knee.,5.  Mildly abnormal chest x-ray.,PLAN:,1.  We will get a C-reactive protein cardiac.,2.  We discussed weight loss options.  I would recommend Weight Watchers or possibly having her see a dietician.  She will think about these options.  She is not able to exercise regularly right now because of knee pain.,3.  We would recommend a screening colonoscopy.  She states that we discussed this in the past and she canceled her appointment to have that done.  She will go ahead and make an appointment to see Dr. XYZ for screening colonoscopy.,4.  We will start Fosamax 70 mg once weekly.  She is to take this in the morning on an empty stomach with full glass of water.  She is not to eat, lie down, or take other medications for at least 30 minutes after taking Fosamax.,5.  I would like to see her back in one to two months.  At that time, we can do preoperative evaluation and we will probably send her to a cardiologist because of mildly abnormal EKG for preoperative cardiac testing.  One would also consider preoperative beta-blocker for cardiac protection.\n",

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia.  However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible.  Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours.  We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture.  If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.,As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH.  Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.,2.  Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above.  No immediate indication for anticoagulation.  If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy.  This was discussed with Dr. X.  Preference would be to run intravenous heparin with PTT of 45 during her thrombocytopenic nadir and initiation of full-dose anticoagulation once nadir is resolved.,3.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient is clinically euvolemic.  Elevated BNP possibly secondary to infarct or renal insufficiency.  Follow volume status closely.  Follow serial BNPs.,4.  Followup.  The patient will be followed while in-house, recommendations made as clinically appropriate.\n",

            "Note: PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a very pleasant 69-year-old Caucasian male whom we are asked to see primarily because of a family history of colon cancer, but the patient also has rectal bleeding on a weekly basis and also heartburn once every 1 or 2 weeks.  The patient states that he had his first colonoscopy 6 years ago and it was negative.  His mother was diagnosed with colon cancer probably in her 50s, but she died of cancer of the esophagus at age 86.  The patient does have hemorrhoidal bleed about once a week.  Otherwise, he denies any change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or weight loss.  He gets heartburn mainly with certain food such as raw onions and he has had it for years.  It will typically occur every couple of weeks.  He has had no dysphagia.  He has never had an upper endoscopy.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , Remarkable for hypertension, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and restless legs syndrome.,SURGICAL HISTORY: , Appendectomy as a child and cholecystectomy in 2003.,MEDICATIONS:  ,His medications are lisinopril 40 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice a day, Januvia 100 mg daily, clonazepam 10 mg at bedtime for restless legs syndrome, Crestor 10 mg nightly, and Flomax 0.4 mg daily.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is retired.

He does not drink alcohol.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Mother had colon cancer in her 50s, esophageal cancer in her 80s.  Her mother smoked and drank.  Father got a mesothelioma at age 65.  There is a brother of 65 with hypertension.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has had prostatitis with benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He has some increased urinary frequency from a history of prostatitis.  He has the heartburn, which is diet dependent and the frequent rectal bleeding.  He also has restless legs syndrome at night.  No cardio or pulmonary complaints.  No weight loss.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Reveals a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress.  BP 112/70.  Pulse 80 and regular.  Respirations non-labored.  Height 5 feet 7-1/2 inches.  Weight 209 pounds.  HEENT exam:  Sclerae are anicteric.  Pupils equal, conjunctivae clear.  No gross oropharyngeal lesions.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or JVD.  Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart sounds are regular without murmur, gallop, or rub.  The abdomen is soft and nontender.  There are no masses.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The bowel sounds are normal.  Rectal examination:  Deferred.  Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Skin is warm and dry.  The patient is alert and oriented with a pleasant affect and no gross motor deficits.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Family history of colon cancer.,2.  Rectal bleeding.,3.  Heartburn and a family history of esophageal cancer.,PLAN:,  I agree with the indications for repeat colonoscopy, which should be done at least every 5 years.  Also, discussed IRC to treat bleeding and internal hemorrhoids if he is deemed to be an appropriate candidate at the time of his colonoscopy and the patient was agreeable.  I am also a little concerned about his family history of esophageal cancer and his personal history of heartburn and suggested that we check him once for Barrett's esophagus.  If he does not have it now then it should not be a significant risk in the future.  The indications and benefits of EGD, colonoscopy, and IRC were discussed.  The risks including sedation, bleeding, infection, and perforation were discussed.  The importance of a good bowel prep so as to minimize missing any lesions was discussed.  His questions were answered and informed consent obtained.  It was a pleasure to care for this nice patient.\n",

History is taken mostly from the emergency room record. The patient is unable to give any history and no family member is present for questioning. When asked why he came to the emergency room, the patient replies that it started about 2 PM yesterday. However, he is unable to tell me exactly what started at 2 PM yesterday. The patient's speech is clear, but he speaks nonsensically using words in combinations that don't make any sense. No other history of present illness is available.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Per the emergency room record, significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, Unknown.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Unknown.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient denies smoking and drinking.,MEDICATIONS:, Per the emergency room record, medications are Lotensin 20 mg daily, Toprol 50 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily and aspirin 81 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:, UNKNOWN.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Unobtainable secondary to the patient's condition.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Temperature: 97.9.

Cardiac isoenzymes are negative times one with a troponin of 0.09.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1. Probable stroke. The patient has an expressive aphasia. He does not have dysarthria, however. Also, his strength is not affected. I suspect that the patient has had strokes or TIAs in the past because he was taking aspirin and Plavix at home. Head CT is reportedly negative. I will ask our radiologist to re-read the head CT. I will also order MRI and MRA, carotid Doppler ultrasound and echocardiogram in addition to a fasting lipid profile. I will consult neurology to evaluate and continue his aspirin and Plavix.,2. Atrial fibrillation. The patient's rate is controlled currently. I will continue him on his amiodarone 200 mg twice daily and consult CHI to evaluate him.,3. Hypertension. I will continue his home medications and add clonidine as needed.,4. Hyperlipidemia. The patient takes no medications for this currently. I will check a fasting lipid profile.,5. Hyperglycemia. It is unknown whether the patient has a history of diabetes. His glucose is currently 171. I will start him on sliding scale insulin for now and monitor closely.,6. Renal insufficiency. It is also unknown whether the patient has a history of this and what his baseline creatinine might be. Currently he has only mild renal insufficiency. This does not appear to be prerenal. Will monitor for now.\n",

The patient complains of fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever.  The patient states that the shunt was placed in February, although according to medical records it was placed in April and it has been periodically clogging since its placement.  The patient had dialysis today, which is Saturday, for approximately one hour before the shunt no longer worked.  The patient had been seen in the Emergency Room yesterday, 08/29/03, by Dr. X for the same problem.  At that time, Dr. X felt that the patient should use the AV fistula during dialysis and after the fistula is able to be used, the PermCath on the right subclavian should be removed.  As mentioned above, he had dialysis today and they were unable to use AV fistula as well as the PermCath read \"did not work\".  The patient has had dialysis since January secondary to hypertension-induced renal failure.  He takes dialysis Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at the ABCD Dialysis Center.  He also was seen at XYZ and he had an apparent thrombectomy with reversal done a few days ago.  The patient's history at this point is a little sketchy; however, he states that he left AMA.

            "Note: PROBLEM:  ,Prescription evaluation for Crohn's disease., ,HISTORY: , This is a 46-year-old male who is here for a refill of Imuran.  He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.  He associates the onset of his symptoms with eating spicy Mexican food., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Reviewed and unchanged.,ALLERGIES: , No known allergies to medications.,OPERATIONS: , Unchanged.,ILLNESSES: , Crohn's disease, vitamin B12 deficiency.,MEDICATIONS:,  Imuran, Nascobal, Vicodin p.r.n., ,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Dated 08/04/04 is reviewed and noted.  Please see pertinent GI issues as discussed above.  Otherwise unremarkable., ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  , GENERAL:  Pleasant male in no acute distress.  Well nourished and well developed. SKIN: indurated, cord-like superficial vein on the right anterior forearm, approx. 3 cm in length.  Non-tender to palpation. No erythema or red streaking.  No edema. LYMPH:  No epitrochlear or axillary lymph node enlargement or tenderness on the right side. , ,DATA REVIEWED: Labs from June 8th and July 19th reviewed.  Liver function tests normal with AST 14 and ALT 44.  WBCs were slightly low at 4.8.  Hemoglobin dropped slightly from 14.1 on 6/8 to 12.9 on 7/19. Hematocrit dropped slightly as well from 43.2 on 6/804 to 40.0 on 7/19/04.  These results were reviewed by Dr. S and lab results letter sent., ,IMPRESSION:  ,1. Crohn's disease, status post terminal ileum resection, on Imuran.  Intermittent symptoms of bowel obstruction.  Last episode three weeks ago.,2.  History of non-specific hepatitis while taking high doses of Tylenol.  Now resolved. ,2.  Increased frequency of reflux symptoms.,3.  Superficial thrombophlebitis, resolving. ,4.  Slightly low H&H., ,PLAN:  ,1.  We discussed Dr. S's recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms.  The patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  The patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  He states understanding of this. Advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. ,2.  Continue with liver panel and ABC every month per Dr. S's instructions.,3.  Continue Imuran 100 mg per day.,4.  Continue to minimize Tylenol use.  The patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not Tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  Dr. S is consulted and agrees that Imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. The patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. ,5.  Reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  Encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter H2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  The patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for Zantac 150 mg per day will be provided.  Reviewed the potential need for upper endoscopy should his symptoms continue or become more frequent.  He does not want to undergo any type of procedure such as that at this time.,6.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 28-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy.  Patient reports that she had gestational diabetes with her first pregnancy.  She did use insulin at that time as well.  She does not fully understand what ketones are.  She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way.  She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 238.3 pounds.  Weight from last week’s visit was 238.9 pounds.  Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds.  Height is 62-3/4 inches.  Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2.  Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time.  Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient’s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient’s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.  Patient was encouraged to call in blood sugars at the end of the week if they are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial.  Provided my name and number should there be additional dietary questions.\n",

Dog was a German shepherd, it belonged to his brother, and the dog spontaneously attacked him.  He sustained a bite to his right lower leg.  Apparently, according to the patient, the dog is well known and is up-to-date on his shots and they wanted to confirm that.  The dog has given no prior history of any reason to believe he is not a healthy dog.  The patient himself developed a puncture wound with a flap injury.  The patient has a flap wound also below the puncture wound, a V-shaped flap, which is pointing towards the foot.  It appears to be viable.  The wound is open about may be roughly a centimeter in the inside of the flap.

There is no mass, adenopathy or bruit.,CHEST:  Normal excursion.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.,COR:  Regular.  There is no S3 or S4 gallop.  There is no obvious murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  It is nontender.  Bowel sounds are present.  There is no tenderness.,SKIN:  He does have like a Chevron incisional scar across his lower chest and upper abdomen.  It appears to be well healed and unremarkable.,GENITALIA:  Deferred.,RECTAL:  Deferred.,EXTREMITIES:  He has about 1+ pitting edema to both legs and they have been present since the surgery.  In the right leg, he has an about midway between the right knee and right ankle on the anterior pretibial area, he has a puncture wound that measures about may be centimeter around that appears to be relatively clean, and just below that about may be 3 cm below, he has a flap traumatic injury that measures about may be 4 cm to the point of the flap.  The wound is spread apart about may be a centimeter all along that area and it is relatively clean.  There was some bleeding when I removed the dressing and we were able to pretty much control that with pressure and some silver nitrate.  There were exposed subcutaneous tissues, but there was no exposed tendons that we could see, etc.  The flap appeared to be viable.,NEUROLOGIC:  Without focal deficits.

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Patient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain.  Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he \"felt it\" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain.,The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time.,The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.  Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines.  He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart.,MEDICATIONS: , In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin.,ALLERGIES:,  HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING).,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is married and lives with his wife.,Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse is elevated at 105.  Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits.,GENERAL:  Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.,BACK:  Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left.  There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion.  There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling.  Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg.  There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well.  DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles.,I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a \"good day.\"  I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a \"bad day,\" he will have nowhere else to turn.  I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night.  It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night.  I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night).  I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping.  The patient is agreeable to this.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Lumbar muscle strain.,2.  Chronic back pain.,PLAN: , At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible.  Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex.  He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet.  I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally.  If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y.\n",

I have encouraged her to start formal physical therapy and a home exercise program.  Will use ice or heat p.r.n.  I have given her refills on Tylenol No.  3, Flector patch, and Relafen not to be taken with any other anti-inflammatory.  She does have some abdominal discomfort with the anti-inflammatories, was started on Nexium 20 mg one p.o. daily.  She will follow up in our office in four weeks.  If she has not gotten any relief with formal physical therapy and the above-noted treatments, we will discuss with Dr. X whether she would benefit from another knee arthroscopy.  The patient shows a good understanding of this treatment plan and agrees.\n",

            "Note: IDENTIFYING DATA:  ,Mr. T is a 45-year-old white male.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Mr. T presented with significant muscle tremor, constant headaches, excessive nervousness, poor concentration, and poor ability to focus.  His confidence and self-esteem are significantly low.  He stated he has excessive somnolence, his energy level is extremely low, motivation is low, and he has a lack for personal interests.  He has had suicidal ideation, but this is currently in remission.  Furthermore, he continues to have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.  Mr. T stated these symptoms appeared approximately two months ago.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , On March 25, 2003, Mr. T was fired from his job secondary, to an event at which he stated he was first being harassed by another employee.\" This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him \"bitch.\" Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to \"deal with it.\",There are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T's life at this time or in recent months.  Mr. T stated that work was his entire life and he based his entire identity on his work ethic.  It should be noted that Mr. T was a process engineer for Plum Industries for the past 14 years.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  There is no evidence of any psychiatric hospitalizations or psychiatric interventions other than a recent visit to Mr. T's family physician, Dr. B at which point Mr. T was placed on Lexapro with an unknown dose at this time.  Mr. T is currently seeing Dr. J for psychotherapy where he has been in treatment since April, 2003.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Mr. T denied any history throughout his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood for depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorders.  He denied any suicide attempts, or profound suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Mr. T furthermore stated that his family psychiatric history is unremarkable.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,  Mr. T stated he used alcohol following his divorce in 1993, but has not used it for the last two years.  No other substance abuse was noted.,LEGAL HISTORY: , Currently, charges are pending over the above described incident.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , Mr. T denied any hospitalizations, surgeries, or current medications use for any heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurological disease, closed head injury, endocrine disease, infectious, blood or muscles disease other than stating he has a hiatal hernia and hypercholesterolemia.,PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: , Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications associated with his birth.  Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.,Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.\n",

            "Note: IDENTIFYING DATA:,  The patient is a 45-year-old white male.  He is unemployed, presumably on disability and lives with his partner.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , \"I'm in jail because I was wrongly arrested.\" The patient is admitted on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,On the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.,I was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient's longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient's dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient's partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was \"useful, but not dosed high enough.\" Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  The patient is fairly vague on his history of AIDS related conditions, but does identify the following:  Thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections; additional details of these problems are not currently known.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his partner.  He is unemployed.  Details of his educational and occupational history are not currently known.  His source of finances is also unknown, though social security disability is presumed.,SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY: , The patient smoked one to two packs per day for most of the last year, but has increased this to two to three packs per day in the last month.  His partner reports that the patient consumed alcohol occasionally, but denies any excessive or binge use recently.  The patient reports smoking marijuana a few times in his life, but not recently.  Denies other illicit substance use.,LEGAL HISTORY:  ,Unknown.,GENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  Also unknown.,MENTAL STATUS EXAM:,Attitude:  The patient demonstrates only variable cooperation with interview, requires frequent redirection to respond to questions.  His appearance is cachectic.  The patient is poorly groomed.,Psychomotor:  There is no psychomotor agitation or retardation.  No other observed extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia.,Affect:  His affect is fairly detached.,Mood:  Describes his mood is \"okay.\",Speech:  His speech is normal rate and volume.  Tone, his volume was decreased initially, but this improved during the course of the interview.,Thought Process:  His thought processes are markedly tangential.,Thought content:  The patient is fairly scattered.  He will provide history with frequent redirection, but he does not appear to stay on one topic for any length of time.  He denies currently auditory or visual hallucinations, though his partner says that this is a feature present at baseline.  Paranoid delusions are elicited.,Homicidal/Suicidal Ideation:  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Denies previous suicide attempts.,Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person and year only.  His memory is intact to names of his Madison Clinic providers.,Insight/Judgment:  His insight is absent as evidenced by his repeated questioning of the validity of his AIDS and mental health diagnoses.  His judgment is poor as evidenced by his longstanding pattern of minimal engagement in treatment of his mental health and physical health conditions.,Assets:  His assets include his housing and his history of supportive relationship with his partner over many years.,Limitations:  His limitations include his AIDS and his history of poor compliance with treatment.,FORMULATION:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old white male with a history of schizophrenia and AIDS.  He was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.  It is unclear to me how much his presentation is a direct expression of an AIDS-related condition, though I suspect the impact of his HIV status is likely to be substantial.,DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Schizophrenia by history.  Rule out AIDS-induced psychosis.  Rule out AIDS-related cognitive disorder.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  AIDS (stable by his report).  Anemia.,AXIS IV:  Relationship strain and the possibility that he may be unable to return to his home upon discharge; minimal engagement in mental health and HIV-related providers.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment Functioning is currently 15.,PLAN: , I will attempt to increase the database, will specifically request records from the last mental health providers.  The Internal Medicine Service will evaluate and treat any acute medical issues that could be helpful to collaborate with his providers at Clinic regarding issues related to his AIDS diagnosis.  With the patient's permission, I will start quetiapine at a dose of 100 mg at bedtime, given the patient's partner report of partial, but response to this agent in the past.  I anticipate titrating further for effect during the course of his admission.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Abdominal pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 71-year-old female patient of Dr. X. The patient presented to the emergency room last evening with approximately 7- to 8-day history of abdominal pain which has been persistent.  She was seen 3 to 4 days ago at ABC ER and underwent evaluation and discharged and had a CT scan at that time and she was told it was \"normal.\"  She was given oral antibiotics of Cipro and Flagyl.  She has had no nausea and vomiting, but has had persistent associated anorexia.  She is passing flatus, but had some obstipation symptoms with the last bowel movement two days ago.  She denies any bright red blood per rectum and no history of recent melena.  Her last colonoscopy was approximately 5 years ago with Dr. Y. She has had no definite fevers or chills and no history of jaundice.  The patient denies any significant recent weight loss.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Significant for history of atrial fibrillation, under good control and now in normal sinus rhythm and on metoprolol and also on Premarin hormone replacement.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Significant for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy.  She has a long history of known grade 4 bladder prolapse and she has been seen in the past by Dr. Chip Winkel, I believe that he has not been re-consulted.,ALLERGIES: , SHE IS ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO MACRODANTIN.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not drink or smoke.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Otherwise negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly thin white female, very pleasant, in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Her temperature is 98.8 and vital signs are all stable, within normal limits.,HEENT:  Head is grossly atraumatic and normocephalic.  Sclerae are anicteric.  The conjunctivae are non-injected.,NECK:  Supple.,CHEST:  Clear.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Generally nondistended and soft.  She is focally tender in the left lower quadrant to deep palpation with a palpable fullness or mass and focally tender, but no rebound tenderness.  There is no CVA or flank tenderness, although some very minimal left flank tenderness.,PELVIC:  Currently deferred, but has history of grade 4 urinary bladder prolapse.,EXTREMITIES:  Grossly and neurovascularly intact.,LABORATORY VALUES:  ,White blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 12.8, and platelet count normal.  Alkaline phosphatase elevated at 184.  Liver function tests otherwise normal.  Electrolytes normal.  Glucose 134, BUN 4, and creatinine 0.7.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , A 71-year-old female with greater than one-week history of abdominal pain now more localized to the left lower quadrant.  Currently is a nonacute abdomen.  The working diagnosis would be sigmoid diverticulitis.  She does have a history in the distant past of sigmoid diverticulitis.  I would recommend a repeat stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and keep the patient nothing by mouth.  The patient was seen 5 years ago by Dr. Y in Colorectal Surgery.  We will consult her also for evaluation.  The patient will need repeat colonoscopy in the near future and be kept nothing by mouth now empirically.  The case was discussed with the patient's primary care physician, Dr. X. Again, currently there is no indication for acute surgical intervention on today's date, although the patient will need close observation and further diagnostic workup.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY: , The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety.  The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals.  The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.,STUDY:,  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.,ORAL STAGE:  ,The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE:  ,No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.,PLAN:  ,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.,2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.,The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.,Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.  She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Left elbow pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This 17-year-old male was fighting with some other kids in Juvenile Hall when he felt some pain in his left elbow, causing sudden pain.  He also has pain in his left ankle, but he is able to walk normally.  He has had previous pain in his left knee.  He denies any passing out, any neck pain at this time even though he did get hit in the head.  He has no chest or abdominal pain.  Apparently, no knives or guns were involved.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had toe problems and left knee pain in the past.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , No coughing, sputum production, dyspnea or chest pain.  No vomiting or abdominal pain.  No visual changes.  No neurologic deficits other than some numbness in his left hand.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is in Juvenile Hall for about 25 more days.  He is a nonsmoker.,ALLERGIES: , MORPHINE.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Abilify.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  Conjunctivae anicteric.  Skull is normocephalic.  He is not complaining of bruising.  HEENT:  TMs and canals are normal.  There is no Battle sign.  NECK:  Supple.  He has good range of motion.  Spinal processes are normal to palpation.  LUNGS:  Clear.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate.  No murmurs or rubs.  EXTREMITIES:  Left elbow is tender.  He does not wish to move it at all.  Shoulder and clavicle are within normal limits.  Wrist is normal to inspection.  He does have some pain to palpation.  Hand has good capillary refill.  He seems to have decreased sensation in all three dermatomes.  He has moderately good abduction of all fingers.  He has moderate opponens strength with his thumb.  He has very good extension of all of his fingers with good strength.,We did an x-ray of his elbow.  He has a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length.  The proximal part looks like it is in good position.  The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement.  There is no significant angulation.  The joint itself appears to be intact.  The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint.  I do not see any extra blood in the joint.  I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign.,I spoke with Dr. X.  He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up.  At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision.  The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time.,Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow.,He had much better comfort once this was applied.  There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort.,Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass.,We then gave him a sling.,We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go.  Gave him a prescription for #15 more and warned him to take it only at nighttime and use Tylenol or Motrin, and ice in the daytime.,I gave him the name and telephone number of Dr. X whom they can follow up with.  They were warned to come back here if he has increasing neurologic deficits in his hands or any new problems.,DIAGNOSES:,1.  Fracture of the humerus, spiral.,2.  Possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia.,3.  Psychiatric disorder, unspecified.,DISPOSITION:  The patient will follow up as mentioned above.  They can return here anytime as needed.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY:,  A is here for a follow up appointment at our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic as well as the CCS Clinic.  A is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis of his right knee.  He had a joint injection back in 03/2007 and since then he has been doing relatively well.  He is taking Indocin only as needed even though he said he has pain regularly, and he said that his knee has not changed since the beginning, but he said he only takes the medicine when he has pain, which is not every day, but almost every day.  He denies any swelling more than what it was before, and he denies any other joints are affected at this moment.  Denies any fevers or any rashes.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On physical examination, his temperature is 98.6, weight is 104.6 kg; which is 4.4 kg less than before, 108/70 is his blood pressure, weight is 91.0 kg, and his pulse is 80.  He is alert, active, and oriented in no distress.  He has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limit.  He has no cataracts and symmetric pupils to light and accommodation.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rhythm with no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender with no :  visceromegaly.  Musculoskeletal examination showed good range of motion of all his upper extremities with no swelling or tenderness.  Lower extremities:  He still has some weakness of the knees, hip areas, and the calf muscles.  He does have minus/plus swelling of the right knee with a very hypermobile patella.  There is no limitation in his range of motion, and the swelling is very minimal with some mild tenderness.,In terms of his laboratories, they were not done today.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis.  He is HLA-B27 negative.,PLAN:,  In terms of the plan, I discussed with him what things he should be taking and the fact that since he has persistent symptoms, he should be on medication every day.  I am going to switch him to Indocin 75 mg SR just to give more sustained effect to his joints, and if he does not respond to this or continue with the symptoms, we may need to get an MRI.  We will see him back in three months.  He was evaluated by our physical therapist, who gave him some recommendations in terms of exercise for his lower extremities.  Future plans for A may include physical therapy and more stronger medications as well as imaging studies with an MRI.  Today he received his flu shot.  Discussed this with A and his aunt and they had no further questions.\n",

            "Note: XYZ Street,City, State,Dear Dr. CD:,Thank you for seeing Mr. XYZ, a pleasant 19-year-old male who has seen you in 2005 for suspected seizure activity.  He comes to my office today continuing on Dilantin 300 mg daily and has been seizure episode free for the past 2 1/2 years.  He is requesting to come off the Dilantin at this point.  Upon reviewing your 2005 note there was some discrepancy as to the true nature of his episodes to the emergency room and there was consideration to reconsider medication use.  His physical exam, neurologically, is normal at this time.  His Dilantin level is slightly low at 12.5.,I will appreciate your evaluation and recommendation as to whether we need to continue the Dilantin at this time.  I understand this will probably entail repeating his EEG and so please coordinate this through Health Center.  I await your response and whether we should continue this medication.  If you require any laboratory, we use ABC Diagnostic and any further testing that is needed should be coordinated at Health Center prior to scheduling.\n",

            "Note: EXAM:  ,Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy.,HISTORY: , 30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder.  The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.  Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.,3.  Suspicious mammographic findings.  The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied.  Further pathologic analysis is pending.,BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.,MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:,1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.,2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.,3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.\n",

            "Note: REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Regarding weakness and a history of polymyositis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is an 87-year-old white female who gives a history of polymyositis diagnosed in 1993. The patient did have biopsy of the quadriceps muscle performed at that time which, per her account, did show an abnormality. She was previously followed by Dr. C, neurology, over several years but was last followed up in the last three to four years. She is also seeing Dr. R at rheumatology in the past. Initially, she was treated with steroids but apparently was intolerant of that. She was given other therapy but she is unclear of the details of that. She has had persistent weakness of the bilateral lower extremities and has ambulated with the assistance of a walker for many years. She has also had a history of spine disease though the process there is not known to me at this time.,She presented on February 1, 2006 with productive cough, fevers and chills, left flank rash and pain there as well as profound weakness. Since admission, she has been diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonic process as well as shingles and is on therapy for both. She reports that strength in the proximal upper extremities has remained good. However, she has no grip strength. Apparently, this has been progressive over the last several years as well. She also presently has virtually no strength in the lower extremities and that is worse within the last few days. Prior to admission, she has had cough with mild shortness of breath. Phlegm has been dark in color. She has had reflux and occasional dysphagia. She has also had constipation but no other GI issues. She has no history of seizure or stroke like symptoms. She occasionally has headaches. No vision changes. Other than the left flank skin changes, she has had no other skin issues. She does have a history of DVT but this was 30 to 40 years ago. No history of dry eyes or dry mouth. She denies chest pain at present.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:, Hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, congestive heart failure, hypertension, history of DVT, previous colonoscopy that was normal, renal artery stenosis.,MEDICATIONS:, Medications prior to admission: Os-Cal, Zyrtec, potassium, Plavix, Bumex, Diovan.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, Acyclovir, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, Diovan, albuterol, Robitussin, hydralazine, Atrovent.,ALLERGIES:, NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, She is a widow. She has 8 children that are healthy with the exception of one who has coronary artery disease and has had bypass. She also has a son with lumbar spine disease. No tobacco, alcohol or IV drug abuse.,FAMILY HISTORY:, No history of neurologic or rheumatologic issues.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, As above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: She is afebrile. Current temperature 98. Respirations 16, heart rate 80 to 90. Blood pressure 114/55.,GENERAL APPEARANCE: She is alert and oriented and in no acute distress. She is pleasant. She is reclining in the bed.,HEENT: Pupils are reactive. Sclera are clear. Oropharynx is clear.,NECK: No thyromegaly. No lymphadenopathy.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart is regular rate and rhythm.,RESPIRATORY: Lungs have a few rales only.,ABDOMEN: Positive bowel sounds. Soft, nontender, nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES: No edema.,SKIN: Left flank dermatome with vesicular rash that is red and raised consistent with zoster.,JOINTS: No synovitis anywhere. Strength is 5/5 in the proximal upper extremities. Proximal lower extremities are 0 out of 5. She has no grip strength at present.,NEUROLOGICAL: Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact. Reflexes 2/4 at the biceps, brachial radialis, triceps. Nil out of four at the patella and Achilles bilaterally. Sensation seems normal. Chest x-ray shows COPD, left basilar infiltrate, cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic changes.,LABORATORY DATA:, White blood cell count 6.1, hemoglobin 11.9, platelets 314,000. Sed rate 29 and 30. Electrolytes: Sodium 134, potassium 4.9, creatinine 1.2, normal liver enzymes. TSH is slightly elevated at 5.38. CPK 36, BNP 645. Troponin less than 0.04.,IMPRESSION:,1. The patient has a history of polymyositis, apparently biopsy proven with a long standing history of bilateral lower extremity weakness. She has experienced dramatic worsening in the last 24 hours of the lower extremity weakness. This in the setting of an acute illness, presumably a pneumonic process.,2. She also gives a history of spine disease though the details of that process are not available either.,The question raised at this time is of recurrence in inflammatory myopathy which would need to include not only polymyositis but also inclusion body myositis versus progressive spine disease versus weakness secondary to acute illness versus neuropathic process versus other.,3. Zoster of the left flank.,4. Left lower lobe pneumonic process.,5. Elevation of the thyroid stimulating hormone.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. I have asked Dr. C to see the patient and he has done so tonight. He is planning for EMG nerve conduction study in the morning.,2. I would consider further spine evaluation pending review of the EMG nerve conduction study.,3. Agree with supportive care being administered thus far and will follow along with you.\n",

The patient had a positive hCG with a negative sonogram and hCG titer of about 18,000.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a possible incomplete abortion, to rule out ectopic pregnancy or rupture of corpus luteal cyst.  The patient was kept in observation for 24 hours.  The sonogram stated there was no gestational sac, but there was a small mass within the uterus that could represent a gestational sac.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  A repeat hCG titer done on the same day came back as 15,000, but then the following day, it came back as 18,000.  The diagnosis of a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy was established.  The patient was taken to surgery and a laparotomy was performed with findings of a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  The right salpingectomy was performed with no complications.  The patient received 2 units of red packed cells.  On admission, her hemoglobin was 12.9, then in the afternoon it dropped to 8.1, and the following morning, it was 7.9.  Again, based on these findings, the severe abdominal pain, we made the diagnosis of ectopic and it was proved or confirmed at surgery.  The hospital course was uneventful.  There was no fever reported.  The abdomen was soft.  She had a normal bowel movement.  The patient was dismissed on 09/09/2007 to be followed in my office in 4 days.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Right shoulder pain.,HISTORY: , The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02.  She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Negative aside from above.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,Please see above.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative aside from above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.,DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient comes back to see me today.  She is a pleasant 73-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain, lumbar degenerative disc disease, lumbar spondylosis, facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis primarily bilateral recess, intermittent lower extremity radiculopathy, DJD of both knees, bilateral pes anserinus bursitis, and chronic pain syndrome.  Dr. XYZ had performed right and left facet and sacroiliac joint injections, subsequent right L3 to S1 medial branch blocks and radiofrequency ablation on the right from L3 to S1.  She was subsequently seen with some mid back pain and she had right T8-T9 and T9-T10 facet injections on 10/28/2004.  She was last seen on 04/08/2005 with recurrent pain in her low back on the right.  Dr. XYZ repeated her radiofrequency ablation on the right side from L3-S1 on 05/04/2005.,The patient comes back to see me today.  She states that the radiofrequency ablation has helped her significantly there, but she still has one spot in her low back that seems to be hurting her on the right, and seems to be pointing to her right sacroiliac joint.  She is also complaining of pain in both knees.  She says that 20 years ago she had a cortisone shot in her knees, which helped her significantly.  She has not had any x-rays for quite some time.  She is taking some Lortab 7.5 mg tablets, up to four daily, which help her with her pain symptoms.  She is also taking Celebrex through Dr. S’ office.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unchanged from my visit of 04/08/2005.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female.,Vital Signs:  Height is 5 feet 5 inches.

Lumbar spinal stenosis, primarily lateral recess with intermittent lower extremity radiculopathy, stable.,8.  Degenerative disc disease of both knees, symptomatic.,9.  Pes anserinus bursitis, bilaterally symptomatic.,10.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  She has some symptoms in her low back on the right side at the sacroiliac joint.  Dr. XYZ will plan having her come in and injecting her right sacroiliac joint under fluoroscopy.  She is also having pain in both knees.  We will plan on x-rays of both knees, AP and lateral, and plan on seeing her back on Monday or Friday for possible intraarticular and/or pes anserine bursa injections bilaterally.  I explained the rationale for each of these injections, possible complications and she wishes to proceed.  In the interim, she can continue on Lortab and Celebrex.  We will plan for the follow up following these interventions, sooner if needed.  She voiced understanding and agreement.  Physical exam findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.\n",

            "Note: SUMMARY OF CLINICAL HISTORY:,  The patient was a 35-year-old African-American male with no significant past medical history who called EMS with shortness of breath and chest pain.  Upon EMS arrival, patient was tachypneic at 40 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 90%.  At the scene, EMS administered breathing treatments and checked lung sounds that did not reveal any evidence of fluid in the lung fields.  EMS also reports patient was agitated upon their arrival at his residence.  Two minutes after arrival at UTMB at 1500, the patient became unresponsive, apneic, and had oxygen saturations from 80-90%.  The patient's heart rate decreased to asystole, was intubated with good breath sounds and air movement.  Patient then had wide complex bradycardia and ACLS protocol for pulseless electrical activity was followed for 45 minutes.  The patient was administered TPA with no improvement.  Bedside echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion.  The patient was administered D5W, Narcan, and multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate.  The patient had three episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation with cardioversion/defibrillation resulting in asystole.  The patient was pronounced dead at 1605 with fixed, dilated pupils, no heart sounds, no pulse and no spontaneous respirations.,DESCRIPTION OF GROSS LESIONS,EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:,  The body is that of a 35-year-old well-developed, well-nourished male.  There is no peripheral edema of the extremities.  There is an area of congestion/erythema on the upper chest and anterior neck.  There are multiple small areas of hemorrhage bilaterally in the conjunctiva.  A nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are in place.  There is an intravenous line in the right hand and left femoral region.  The patient has multiple lead pads on the thorax.  The patient has no other major surgical scars.,INTERNAL EXAMINATION (BODY CAVITIES):,  The right and left pleural cavity contains 10 ml of clear fluid with no adhesions.  The pericardial sac is yellow, glistening without adhesions or fibrosis and contains 30 ml of a straw colored fluid.  There is minimal fluid in the peritoneal cavity.,HEART:,  The heart is large with a normal shape and a weight of 400 grams.  The pericardium is intact.  The epicardial fat is diffusely firm.  As patient was greater than 48 hours post mortem, no TTC staining was utilized.  Upon opening the heart was grossly normal without evidence of infarction.  There were slightly raised white plaques in the left ventricle wall lining.  The left ventricle measures 2.2 cm, the right ventricle measures 0.2 cm, the tricuspid ring measures 11 cm, the pulmonic right measures 8 cm, the mitral ring measures 10.2 cm, and the aortic ring measures 7 cm.  The foramen ovale is closed.  The circulation is left dominant.  Examination of the great vessels of the heart reveals minimal atherosclerosis with the area of greatest stenosis (20% stenosis) at the bifurcation of the LAD.,AORTA:,  There is minimal atherosclerosis with no measurable plaques along the full length of the ascending and descending aorta.,LUNGS: , The right lung weighed 630 grams, the left weighed 710 grams.  The lung parenchyma is pink without evidence of congestion of hemorrhage.  The bronchi are grossly normal.  In the right lung, there are two large organizing thrombo-emboli.  The first is located at the first branch of the pulmonary artery with an older, organizing area adherent to the vessel wall measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 2.5 cm.  Surrounding this organizing area is a newer area of apparent thrombosis completely occluding the bifurcation.  The other large organizing, adherent embolus is located further in out in the vasculature measuring approximately 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.5 cm.  There are multiple other emboli located in smaller pulmonary vessels that show evidence of distending the vessels they are located inside.,GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:,  The esophagus and stomach are normal in appearance without evidence of ulcers or varices.  The stomach contains approximately 800 ml, without evidence of any pills or other non-foodstuff material.  The pancreas shows a normal lobular cut surface with evidence of autolysis.  The duodenum, ileum, jejunum and colon are all grossly normal without evidence of abnormal vasculature or diverticula.  An appendix is present and is unremarkable.  The liver weighs 2850 grams and the cut surface reveals a normal liver with no fibrosis present grossly.  The gallbladder is in place with a probe patent bile duct through to the ampulla of Vater.,RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM:,  The spleen is large weighing 340 grams, the cut surface reveals a normal appearing white and red pulp.  No abnormally large lymph nodes were noted.,GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:,  The right kidney weighs 200 grams, the left weighs 210 grams.  The left kidney contains a 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 simple cyst containing a clear fluid.  The cut surface reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla with intact calyces.  The prostate and seminal vessels were cut revealing normal appearing prostate and seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of inflammation or embolus.,ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:,  The adrenal glands are in the normal position and weigh 8.0 grams on the right and 11.6 grams on the left.  The cut surface of the adrenal glands reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla.  The thyroid gland weighs 12.4 grams and is grossly normal.,EXTREMITIES:,  Both legs and calves were measured and found to be very similar in circumference.  Both legs were also milked and produced no clots in the venous system.,CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION,This patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature., ,The most significant finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung.  The autopsy revealed evidence of multiple emboli in the right lung that were at least a few days old because the emboli that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall.  In order to be adherent to the vessel wall, the emboli must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response, which takes at least a few days.  The fatal event was not the old emboli in the right lung, but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery.  This created a high-pressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the patient's demise.,Although this case is fairly straight forward in terms of what caused the terminal event, perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35-year-old man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism.  Virchow's triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury, stasis and a hypercoagulable state as possible etiologies.  The age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis as the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed.  The autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the occlusion.  The next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state.  Some possibilities include obesity, trauma, surgery, cancer, Factor V Leiden deficiency (as well as other inherited disorders-prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, and disorders of plasminogen), and Lupus anticoagulant.  Of these risks factors, obesity was the only risk factor the patient was known to have.  The patient had no evidence of trauma, surgery, cancer or the stigmata of SLE, therefore these are unlikely.  Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable state (Factor V Leiden being the most common).,In summary, this patient died of a pulmonary embolism, the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined.  A definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory tests and a more detailed history.,SUMMARY AND REFLECTION,WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS AUTOPSY:,  I learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious, the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive.  This patient was an otherwise completely healthy 35-year-old man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable state.,REMAINING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS:,  Basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined.  Once that question is answered I believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the patient's family.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.\n",

            "Note: REASON FOR CONSULT: , Essential tremor and torticollis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly \"no- no\" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Klonopin 0.5 mg twice a day.,2.  Primidone 100 mg b.i.d.,3.

She complains of hearing decreased on the left.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.  No constipation.  She does give a history of urge incontinence.  No rashes.  No depressive symptoms.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 131/72, pulse is 50, and weight is 71.3 kg.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal.  Regular rate and rhythm.  She does have a rash over the right ankle with a prior basal cell carcinoma was resected.  NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x4.  Speech shows a voice tremor occasionally.  Language is intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Motor examination showed 5/5 power in all extremities with minimal increased tone.  Sensory examination was intact to light touch.  Reflexes were brisk bilaterally, but they were equal and both toes were downgoing.  Her coordination showed minimal intentional component to bilateral finger-to-nose.  Gait was intact.  Lot of swing on Romberg's.  The patient did have a tremor both upper extremities, right more than left.  She did have a head tremor, which was no-no variety, and she had a minimal torticollis with her head twisted to the left.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This 62-year-old white female has essential tremor and mild torticollis.  Tremor not bothersome for most activities of daily living, but she does have a great difficulty writing, which is totally illegible.  The patient did not wish to change any of her medication doses at this point.  We will go ahead and check MRI brain, and we will get the films later.  We will see her back in 3 months.  Also, the patient declined any possible Botox for the mild torticollis she has at this point.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY: , The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.,On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.,OBJECTIVE:,  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.,2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.,MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ.  If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today’s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient’s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Leg pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 56-year-old female who has pain in her legs at nighttime and when she gets up it comes and goes, radiates from her buttocks to her legs, sometimes it is her ankle.  She has noticed it since she has been on Lipitor.  She has had some night sweats occasionally.  She has had a little bit of fever and nausea.  She has noticed her blood sugars have been low.  She has lost over 30 pounds after exercising doing water aerobics at Genesis in Wichita.  She has noticed her fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 100 to 120.  Blood sugars one and a half hours after meals have been 185.  She is coming in for a diabetic checkup in one month and wants lab prior to that time.  She has been eating more meat recently and has not been on a diet for cholesterol.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Include Lipitor 80 mg q.d. discontinued today, Vioxx 25 mg q.d., Maxzide 37/25 q.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d., hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg at h.s., aspirin 81 mg q.d., Glucovance 1.25/250 b.i.d. decreased to one a day today, Monopril 20 mg q.d., estradiol one mg q.d., and glucosamine 1000 mg q.d.,ALLERGIES:,  Cipro, sulfa, Bactrim, and Demerol.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight is 248 pounds which is a 12-pound drop from January.

Pulse 68.,General:  This is a well-developed adult female, awake, alert, and in no acute distress.,HEENT:  Oropharynx and HEENT are within normal limits.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rhythm and rate.,Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended without organomegaly.,GU:  Palpation of femurs do not cause pain, rotation of hips do not cause pain, and compression of the hips do not cause pain.,Neurologic:  Deep tendon reflexes are normal.,Extremities:  Pulses in lower extremities are normal.  Straight leg lifts are normal.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,1.  Leg pain/bone pain, I am going to check her CMP.  I think this possibly is a side effect from Lipitor.  We will stop Lipitor, have her follow up in one month which she has already got planned for diabetes appointment and check symptoms at that time.  Certainly if her pain improves might consider something like Crestor, which is more water soluble, which may cause less adverse effects.  We will check her comprehensive metabolic panel to make sure the alkaline phosphatase is okay, may need an x-ray of back, hip, and legs at that time if symptoms are not gone.,2.  Hypercholesterolemia, this is somewhat bothersome as she is a diabetic.  Did discuss with her that we need to stick to the diet especially after going off of Lipitor.  We will see how she does with her bone pain/leg pain off of Lipitor.  If she has improvement may consider Crestor in one month.  I am going to check her lipid panel and a CMP.  Apparently, she is going to get this at a different site, Mapleridge in Wichita.,3.  Type II diabetes.  We will decrease her Glucovance because she is having frequent low blood sugars.  Her previous hemoglobin A1c was 5.6 so we will see if this improves her symptoms.  I am also going to check a hemoglobin A1c at Mapleridge in Wichita and have a followup here in one month for that diabetes appointment.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Right hydronephrosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 56-year-old female who has a history of uterine cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma.  She is scheduled to undergo mastectomy in two weeks.  In September 1999, she was diagnosed with right breast cancer and underwent lumpectomy and axillary node dissection and radiation.  Again, she is scheduled for mastectomy in two weeks.  She underwent a recent PET scan for Dr. X, which revealed marked hydronephrosis on the right possibly related to right UPJ obstruction and there is probably a small nonobstructing stone in the upper pole of the right kidney.  There was no dilation of the right ureter noted.  Urinalysis today is microscopically negative.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Uterine cancer, mesothelioma, breast cancer, diabetes, hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Lumpectomy, hysterectomy.,MEDICATIONS:,  Diovan HCT 80/12.5 mg daily, metformin 500 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  None.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is retired.  Does not smoke or drink.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  I have reviewed his review of systems sheet and it is on the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  Please see the physical exam sheet I completed.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, no palpable masses, no CVA tenderness.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Marked right hydronephrosis without hydruria.  She believes she had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis at Hospital in 2005.  I will try to obtain the report to see if the right kidney was evaluated at that time.  She will need evaluation with an IVP and renal scan to determine the point of obstruction and renal function of the right kidney.  She is quite anxious about her upcoming surgery and would like to delay any evaluation of this until the surgery is completed.  She will call us back to schedule the x-rays.  She understands the great importance and getting back in touch with us to schedule these x-rays due to the possibility that it may be somehow related to the cancer.  There is also a question of a stone present in the kidney.  She voiced a complete understanding of that and will call us after she recovers from her surgery to schedule these tests.\n",

Patient has had prior lateral meniscectomy in 2001.,FINDINGS:,Examination was performed on 8/3/05,Normal medial meniscus without intrasubstance degeneration, surface fraying or discrete meniscal tear.,There is subtle irregularity along the superior and inferior articular surfaces of the lateral meniscus, likely reflecting previous partial meniscectomy and contouring, although subtle surface tearing cannot be excluded, particularly along the undersurface of the lateral meniscus (series #3, image #17). There is no displaced tear or displaced meniscal fragment.,There is a mild interstitial sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament without focal tear or discontinuity.,Normal posterior cruciate ligament.,Normal medial collateral ligament.,There is a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon without complete tear.,There is a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule (series #5 images #10-18). There is marrow edema within the posterolateral corner of the tibia, and there is linear signal adjacent to the cortex suggesting that there may be a Segond fracture for which correlation with radiographs is recommended (series #6, images #4-7).,Biceps femoris tendon and iliotibial band are intact and there is no discrete fibular collateral ligament tear. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons.,There is contusion within the posterior non-weight bearing surface of the medial femoral condyle, as well as in the posteromedial corner of the tibia. There is linear vertically oriented signal within the distal tibial diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction (series #7, image #8; series #2, images #4-5). There is no discrete fracture line, and this is of uncertain significance, but this should be correlated with radiographs.,The patellofemoral joint is congruent without patellar tilt or subluxation. Normal medial and lateral patellar retinacula. There is a joint effusion.,IMPRESSION:,Changes within the lateral meniscus most likely reflect previous partial meniscectomy and re-contouring although a subtle undersurface tear in the anterior horn may be present.,Mild anterior cruciate ligament interstitial sprain.,There is a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon and there is a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule with a possible Second fracture which should be correlated with radiographs.,\n",

            "Note: REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  ,Followup of seizures.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old African-American female, well known to the neurology service, who has been referred to me for the first time evaluation of her left temporal lobe epilepsy that was diagnosed in August of 2002.  At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds.  She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop.  She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep.  She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative.  Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy.  She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then.  She reports no seizures in the past several years.  She currently is without complaint.,In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures.  There is no family history of seizures.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant only for hypertension and left temporal lobe epilepsy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Remarkable only for hypertension in her father.  Her mother died in a motor vehicle accident.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She works running a day care at home.  She has three children.  She is married.  She does not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Please see note in chart.  Only endorses weight gain and the history of seizures, as well as some minor headaches treated with over-the-counter medications.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil, and hydrochlorothiazide.,ALLERGIES: , Flagyl and aspirin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Blood pressure is 138/88, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 18, and weight is 224 pounds, pain scale is none.,General Examination:  Please see note in chart, which is essentially unremarkable except mild obesity.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: , Again, please see note in chart.  Mental status is normal, cranial nerves are intact, motor is normal bulk and tone throughout with no weakness appreciated in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.  There is no drift and there are no abnormalities to orbit.  Sensory examination, light touch, and temperature intact at all distal extremities.  Cerebellar examination, she has normal finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movements, heel-to-shin, and foot tap.,She rises easily from the chair.  She has normal step, stride, arm swing, toe, heel, and tandem.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and equal at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and 1 at the ankles.,She was seen in the emergency room for chest pain one month ago.  CT of the head was performed, which I reviewed, dated September 07, 2006.  The findings were within the range of normal variation.  There is no evidence of bleeding, mass, lesions, or any evidence of atrophy.,IMPRESSION: , This is a pleasant 47-year-old African-American female with what appears to be cryptogenic left temporal lobe epilepsy that is very well controlled on her current dose of lamotrigine.,PLAN:,1.  Continue lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.,2.  I discussed with the patient the option of a trial of medications.  We need to repeat her EEG as well as her MRI prior to weaning her medications.  The patient wants to continue her lamotrigine at this time.  I concur.,3.  The patient will be following up with me in six months.,\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 26-year-old female, referred to Physical Therapy for low back pain.  The patient has a history of traumatic injury to low back.  The patient stated initial injury occurred eight years ago, when she fell at a ABC Store.  The patient stated she received physical therapy, one to two visits and received modality treatment only, specifically electrical stimulation and heat pack per patient recollection.  The patient stated that she has had continuous low-back pain at varying degrees for the past eight years since that fall.  The patient gave birth in August 2008 and since the childbirth, has experienced low back pain.  The patient also states that she fell four to five days ago, while mopping her floor.  The patient stated that she landed on her tailbone and symptoms have increased since that fall.  The patient stated that her initial physician examination with Dr. X was on 01/10/09, and has a followup appointment on 02/10/09.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, thyroid, kidney, or bladder dysfunctions.  The patient stated that she quit smoking prior to her past childbirth and is currently not pregnant.  The patient has had a C-section and also an appendectomy.  The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident four to five years ago and at that time, the patient did not require any physical therapy nor did she report any complaints of increased back pain following that accident.,MEDICATIONS: , Patient currently states she is taking:,1.  Vicodin 500 mg two times a day.,2.  Risperdal.,3.  Zoloft.,4.  Stool softeners.,5.  Prenatal pills.,DIAGNOSTIC IMAGERY:  ,The patient states she has not had an MRI performed on her lumbar spine.  The patient also states that Dr. X took x-rays two weeks ago, and no fractures were found at that time.  Per physician note, dated 12/10/08, Dr. X dictated that the x-ray showed an anterior grade 1 spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1, and requested Physical Therapy to evaluate and treat.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient states that pain is constant in nature with a baseline of 6-7/10 with pain increasing to 10/10 during the night or in cold weather.  The patient states that pain is dramatically less, when the weather is warmer.  The patient also states that pain worsens as the day progresses, in that she also hard time getting out of bed in the morning.  The patient states that she does not sleep at night well and sleeps less than one hour at a time.,Aggravating factors include, sitting for periods greater than 20 minutes or lying supine on her back.  Easing factors include side lying position in she attempts to sleep.,OBJECTIVE: , AGE:  26 years old.  HEIGHT:  5 feet 2 inches.  WEIGHT:  The patient is an obese 26-year-old female.,ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION: , Lumbar spine, flexion, lateral flexion and rotation all within functional limits without complaints of pain or soreness while performing them during evaluation.,PALPATION:  ,The patient complained of bilateral SI joint point tenderness.  The patient also complained of left greater trochanter hip point tenderness.  The patient also complained of bilateral paraspinal tenderness on cervical spine to lumbar spine.,STRENGTH:  ,RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:,Knee extension 5/5, hip flexion 5/5, knee flexion 4/5, internal and external hip rotation was 4/5.  With manual muscle testing of knee flexion, hip, internal and external rotation, the patient reports an increase in right SI joint pain to 8/10.,LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY:,Hip flexion 5/5, knee extension 5/5, knee flexion 4/5, hip internal and external rotation 4/5, with slight increase in pain level with manual muscle testing and resistance.  It must be noted that PT did not apply as much resistance during manual muscle testing, secondary to the 8/10 pain elicited during the right lower extremity.,NEUROLOGICAL:  ,The patient subjectively complains of numbness with tingling in her bilateral extremities when she sits longer than 25 minutes.  However, they subside when she stands.  The patient did complain of this numbness and tingling during the evaluation and the patient was seated for a period of 20 minutes.  Upon standing, the patient stated that the numbness and tingling subsides almost immediately.  The patient stated that Dr. X told her that he believes that during her past childbirth when the epidural was being administered that there was a possibility that a sensory nerve may have been also affected during the epidural less causing the numbness and tingling in her bilateral lower extremities.  The patient does not demonstrate any sensation deficits with gentle pressure to the lumbar spine and during manual muscle testing.,GAIT:  ,The patient ambulated out of the examination room, while carrying her baby in a car seat.,ASSESSMENT:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old overweight female, referred to Physical Therapy for low back pain.  The patient presents with lower extremity weakness, which may be contributing to her lumbosacral pain, in that she has poor lumbar stabilization with dynamic ADLs, transfers, and gait activity when fatigued.  At this time, the patient may benefit from skilled physical therapy to address her decreased strength and core stability in order to improve her ADL, transfer, and mobility skills.,PROGNOSIS: , The patient's prognosis for physical therapy is good for dictated goals.,SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN TWO WEEKS:,1.  The patient will be able to sit for greater than 25 minutes without complaints of paraesthesia or pain in her bilateral lower extremities or bilateral SI joints.,2.

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 48-year-old black male with stage IV chronic kidney disease, likely secondary to HIV nephropathy who presents to clinic for followup having missed prior clinic appointments.  He was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X.  This is the first time that I have met the patient.  The patient's history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an HIV-associated complication.  He is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for approximately one year.  He had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3.  When he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his HAART regimen.  Since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his HIV and is seeing Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic.  He is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy.  His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350.  He has had no HIV complications since he was last seen in our clinic.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic, here in ABCD, although he has not seen her in approximately one year.  The patient has an AV fistula that was placed in late 2006.  The latest blood work that I have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a GFR of 22 and a potassium of 5.9.  These laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation.  The only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping.  He was given Ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping.  He says that he has trouble getting to sleep.  The Ambien will allow him to sleep for about two hours, and then he is awake again.  He is tired during the day, but is not taking any daytime naps.  He has no history of excessive snoring or apneic periods.  He has no history of falling asleep at work or while driving.  He has never had a formal sleep study.  He does continue to work in sales at a local butcher shop.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,He denies any change in his appetite.  He has actually gained some weight in recent months.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort.  He denies any pruritus.  He denies any lower extremity edema.  All other systems are reviewed and negative.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Stage IV chronic kidney disease with most recent GFR of 22.,2.  HIV diagnosed in 09/2006 with the most recent CD4 count of 350 in 03/2008.,3.  Hyperlipidemia.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.,6.  Status post right upper extremity AV fistula in the fall of 2006.,7.  History of a right brachial plexus palsy.,8.  Recent lower back pain, status post lumbar steroid injection.,ALLERGIES:,  HE SAYS THAT VITAMIN D HAS CAUSED HEADACHES.,MEDICATIONS:,1.  Kaletra daily.,2.  Epivir one daily.,3.  Ziagen two daily.,4.  Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.,5.  Valsartan 20 mg b.i.d.,6.  Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He lives here in ABCD.  He is employed at the sales counter of a local butcher shop.  He continues to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily, as he has for the past 28 years.  He denies any alcohol or illicit substances.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother is deceased.  He said that she had some type of paralysis before she died.  His father is deceased at age 64 of a head and neck cancer.  He has a 56-year-old brother with type-two diabetes and blindness secondary to diabetic retinopathy.  He has a 41-year-old brother who has hypertension.  He has a sister who has thyroid disease.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 191 pounds.  His temperature is 97.1.  Pulse is 94.  Blood pressure by automatic cuff 173/97, by manual cuff 180/90.,HEENT:  His oropharynx is clear without thrush or ulceration.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.,HEART:  Regular with normal S1 and S2.  There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  He has no JVD.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, without abdominal bruit or organomegaly.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  He has difficulty with abduction of his right shoulder.,ACCESS:  He has a right forearm AV fistula with an audible bruit and a palpable thrill.  There is no sign of stenosis.  The vascular access looks like it is ready to use.,EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema.,SKIN:  No bruises, petechiae, or rash.,LABS:  ,Sodium was 140, potassium 5.9, chloride 114, bicarbonate 18.  BUN is 49, creatinine 4.3.  GFR is 19.  Albumin 3.2.  Protein 7.  AST 17, ALT 16, alkaline phosphatase 106.  Total bilirubin 0.4.  Calcium 9.1., phosphorus 4.7, PTH of 448.  The corrected calcium was 9.7.  WBC is 8.9, hemoglobin 13.4, platelet 226.  Total cholesterol 234, triglycerides 140, LDL 159, HDL 47.  His ferritin is 258, iron is 55, and percent sat is 24.,IMPRESSION:  ,This is a 48-year-old black male with stage IV chronic kidney disease likely secondary to HIV nephropathy, although there is no history of renal biopsy, who has been noncompliant with the Renal Clinic and presents today for followup at the recommendation of his Infection Disease doctors.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Renal.  His serum creatinine is progressively worsening.  His creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and today is 4.3.  This represents a GFR of 19.  This is stage IV chronic kidney disease.  He does have vascular access and this appears to be ready to use.  He is having some difficulty sleeping and it is possible that this represents some early signs of uremia.  Otherwise, he has no signs or symptoms of uremia at this time.  I am going to touch base with the dialysis educator and try to get The patient in to the dialysis teaching classes.  He has already received some literature for the dialysis teaching, but has not yet enrolled in the classes.  I have encouraged him to continue to exercise his right forearm.  I am also going to contact the transplant coordinator and see if he can be evaluated for possible transplant.  Given his progression of his chronic kidney disease, I will anticipate that he will need to start dialysis soon.,2.  Hypertension.  I have added labetolol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen.  He shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his Lasix could be increased.  Goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.,3.  Hyperkalemia.  I am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily.  I will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium.  If his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.,4.  Bone metabolism.  His PTH is elevated and I am going to add PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals.  His corrected calcium is 9.7, and I would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.,5.  Acid base.  His bicarbonate is 18 and I will initiate the sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.,6.  Anemia.  His hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease.  His iron stores are adequate.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY:, This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.,BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:, The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.\n",

She has a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis.  She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines.,The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.  She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily.  She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms.

Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  The patient is symptomatic primarily on her right hip and is planning on seeing an orthopedic surgeon for possible right hip replacement.  In the interim, her Ultracet is not quite taking care of her pain.  I have asked her to discontinue it and we will start her on Tylenol #3, up to four times a day.  I have written a prescription for this for 120 tablets and two refills.  The patient will call for the refills when she needs them.  I will plan further follow up in six months, sooner if needed.

The patient was transferred to Nursing Home and presents today from the nursing home with complaints of bleeding from the right AKA stump and penile discharge.  As per the patient during his hospitalizations over here, he had indwelling Foley catheter for a few days and when he was discharged at the nursing home he was discharged without the catheter.  However, the patient was brought back to the ED today when he suffered fall yesterday and started bleeding from his stump.  While placing the catheter in the ED on retraction of foreskin purulent discharge was seen from the penis and the glans appeared infected, so urology consult was placed.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Negative except as in the HPI.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Right AKA,MEDICATIONS:,  Novolin, Afrin, Nephro-Vite, Neurontin, lisinopril, furosemide, Tums, labetolol, Plavix, nitroglycerin, Aricept, omeprazole, oxycodone, Norvasc, Renagel, and morphine.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN and ADHESIVE TAPE.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, and myocardial infarction.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives alone.

Currently, indwelling Foley catheter in place.  On retraction of the foreskin, pale-looking glans tip with areas of yellow-white tissue.  The proximal glans appeared pink.  The patient currently has indwelling Foley catheter and glans slightly tender to touch.  However, no purulent discharge was seen on compression of the glans.  Otherwise on palpation, no other deformity noticed.  Bilateral testes descended.  No palpable abnormality.  No evidence of infection in his perineal area.,EXTREMITIES:  Right AKA.,NEUROLOGIC:  Awake, alert, and oriented.  No sensory or motor deficit.,LABORATORY DATA: , I independently reviewed the lab work done on the patient.  The patient had a UA done in the ED which showed few bacteria, white blood cells 6 to 12, and a few epithelial cells which were negative.  His basic metabolic panel with creatinine of 7.2 and potassium of 5, otherwise normal.  CBC with a white blood cell count of 11.5, hemoglobin of 9.5, and INR of 1.13.,IMPRESSION: , A 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities with penile discharge and pale-appearing glans.  It seems that the patient has had multiple catheterizations recently and has history of peripheral vascular disease.  I think it is due to chronic ischemic changes.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , Our recommendation would be:,1.  To remove the Foley catheter.,2.  Local hygiene.,3.  Local application of bacitracin ointment.,4.

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.  Attention deficit disorder.,2.  TMJ arthropathy.,3.  Migraines.,4.  Osteoarthritis as described above.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.  Cystectomies.,2.  Sinuses.,3.

The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics,In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient’s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

            "Note: REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Mesothelioma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 73-year-old pleasant Caucasian male who is known to me from his previous hospitalization.  He has also been seen by me in the clinic in the last few weeks.  He was admitted on January 18, 2008, with recurrent malignant pleural effusion.  On the same day, he underwent VATS and thoracoscopic drainage of the pleural effusion with right pleural nodule biopsy, lysis of adhesions, and directed talc insufflation by Dr. X.  He was found to have 2.5L of bloody pleural effusions, some loculated pleural effusion, adhesions, and carcinomatosis in the parenchyma.  His hospital course here has been significant for dyspnea, requiring ICU stay.  He also had a chest tube, which was taken out few days ago.  He has also had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which he has been on amiodarone by cardiologist.  The biopsy from the pleural nodule done on the right on January 18, 2008, shows malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with mesothelioma.  Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells positive for calretinin and focally positive for D2-40, MOC-31.  Tumor cells are negative for CDX-2, and monoclonal CEA.,The patient at this time reports that overall he has been feeling better with decrease in shortness of breath and cough over the last few days.  He does have edema in his lower extremities.  He is currently on 4L of oxygen.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, recent change in bowel habit, melena, or hematochezia.  No neurological or musculoskeletal signs or symptoms.  He reports that he is able to ambulate to the bathroom, but gets short of breath on exertion.  He denies any other complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction as per the previous echocardiogram done in December 2007, history of pneumonia in December 2007, admitted to XYZ Hospital.  History of recurrent pleural effusions, status post pleurodesis and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer as per the biopsy that was done in XYZ Hospital.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,In the hospital are amiodarone, diltiazem, enoxaparin, furosemide, methylprednisolone, pantoprazole, Zosyn, p.r.n. acetaminophen, and hydrocodone.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is married and lives with his spouse.  He has history of tobacco smoking and also reports history of alcohol abuse.  No history of illicit drug abuse.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Significant for history of ?cancer? in the mother and history of coronary artery disease in the father.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , As stated above.  He denies any obvious asbestos exposure, as far as he can remember.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  He is awake, alert, in no acute distress.  He is currently on 4L of oxygen by nasal cannula.,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 97/65 mmHg, respiration is 20 per minute, pulse is 72 per minute, and temperature 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit.,HEENT:  No icterus or sinus tenderness.  Oral mucosa is moist.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation except few diffuse wheezing present bilaterally.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended, and nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral pedal edema is present in both the extremities.  No signs of DVT.,NEUROLOGICAL:  Grossly nonfocal.,INVESTIGATION:,  Labs done on January 28, 2008, showed BUN of 23 and creatinine of 0.9.  Liver enzymes checked on January 17, 2008, were unremarkable.  CBC done on January 26, 2008, showed WBC of 19.8, hemoglobin of 10.7, hematocrit of 30.8, and platelet count of 515,000.  Chest x-ray from yesterday shows right-sided Port-A-Cath, diffuse right lung parenchymal and pleural infiltration without change, mild pulmonary vascular congestion.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Mesothelioma versus primary lung carcinoma, two separate reports as for the two separate biopsies done several weeks apart.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.,4.  Malignant pleural effusion, status post surgery as stated above.,5.  Anemia of chronic disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  Compare the slides from the previous biopsy done in December at XYZ Hospital with recurrent pleural nodule biopsy slides.  I have discussed regarding this with Dr. Y in Pathology here at Methodist XYZ Hospital.  I will try to obtain the slides for comparison from XYZ Hospital for comparison and immunohistochemical staining.,2.  I will also discuss with Dr. X and also with intervention radiologist at XYZ Hospital regarding the exact sites of the two biopsies.,3.  Once the results of the above are available, I will make further recommendations regarding treatment.  The patient has significantly decreased performance status with dyspnea on exertion and is being planned for transfer to Triumph Hospital for rehab, which I agree with.,4.  Continue present care.,Discussed regarding the above in great details with the patient and his wife and daughter and answered the questions to their satisfaction.  They clearly understand the above.  They also understand his very poor performance status at this time, and the risks and benefits of delaying chemotherapy due to this.\n",

            "Note: REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the \"early stages of a likely dementia\" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began \"as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was \"too derogatory.\"  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated \"diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.\"  It concluded that \"results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot \"like dragging.\"  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.

Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.

Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.

The patient speaks English fairly well, but her primary language is Spanish.  Her boyfriend does help to make sure that she understands what we are talking about.  The patient seems to understand our conversation fairly well.  She works at Norcraft and injured her right thumb on 09/10/2004 at 12:15 a.m.  She was pushing a cart and mashed her thumb between the cart and the wall.  This was at the finishing room in Norcraft.  She went ahead and went to work yesterday, which was the 14th, but was not able to work on the 13th.  She has swelling in her thumb.  It hurt only if it is pushed on.  It was the distal end of her thumb that was mashed.  She has not noticed any numbness or tingling or weakness.  She has not sought any treatment for this, is not taking any pain medications.  She did try soaking it in warm salt water and did not notice any improvement.,MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Possible history of chicken pox, otherwise no other medical illnesses.  She has never had any surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Parents and two siblings are healthy.  She has had no children.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is single.  She lives with her boyfriend and his father.  She works at Norcraft.  She wears seatbelt 30% of the time.  I encouraged her to use them all of the time.  She is a nonsmoker, nondrinker.,VACCINATIONS: , She thinks she got a tetanus vaccine in childhood, but does not know for sure.  She does not think she has had a tetanus booster recently.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,Constitutional:  No fevers, chills, or sweats.,Neurologic:  She has had no numbness, tingling, or weakness.,Musculoskeletal:  As above in HPI.  No other difficulties.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant Hispanic female, in no acute distress.,Vital Signs:  Weight:  121.4.  Blood pressure:  106/78.  Pulse:  64.  Respirations:  20.  Temperature:  96.,Extremities:  Examination of the right hand reveals the distal end of the thumb to be swollen especially just proximal to the nail bed.  The nail bed is pushed up.  I can see hematoma below the nail bed, although it does appear to be intact.  She has some blue fingernail polish on her nail also, but that is starting to come off.  She is able to bend her thumb normally at the DIP joint.  She has no discomfort doing that.  Sensation is intact over the entire thumb.  She has normal capillary refill.  There is some erythema and swelling noted especially over the posterior thumb just proximal to the nail bed.  I am not feeling any fluctuance.  I do not think it is a collection of pus.  There is no drainage.  She does have some small fissures in the skin where I think she did injure it with this smashing injury, but no deep lacerations at all.  It looks like there may be some mild cellulitis at the site of her injury.,LABORATORY:,  X-ray of the thumb was obtained and I do not see any sign of fracture or foreign body.,ASSESSMENT:,  Blunt trauma to the distal right thumb without fracture.  I think there is some mild cellulitis developing there.,PLAN:,1.  We will give a tetanus diphtheria booster.,2.  We will start Keflex 500 mg one p.o. q.i.d. x 7 days.  I would recommend that she can return to work, but she is not to do any work that requires the use of her right thumb.  I would like to see her back on Monday, the 20th in the morning and we can see how her thumb is doing at that time.  If she is noticing any difficulties with increased redness, increased warmth, increased pain, pus-like drainage, or any other difficulties, she is to go ahead and give us a call.  Otherwise I will be seeing her back on Monday.\n",

            "Note: DIAGNOSIS: , Chronic laryngitis, hoarseness.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 68-year-old male, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy secondary to voicing difficulties.  The patient attended initial evaluation plus 3 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which focused on training the patient to complete resonant voice activities and to improve his vocal hygiene.  The patient attended therapy one time a week and was given numerous home activities to do in between therapy sessions.  The patient made great progress and he came in to discuss with an appointment on 12/23/08 stating that his voice had finally returned to \"normal\".,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  To be independent with relaxation and stretching exercises and Lessac-Madsen Resonant Voice Therapy Protocol.,2.  He also met short-term goal therapy 3 and he is independent with resonant voice therapy tasks.,3.  We did not complete his __________ ratio during his last session; so, I am unsure if he had met his short-term goal number 2.,4.  To be referred for a videostroboscopy, but at this time, the patient is not in need of this evaluation.  However, in the future if hoarseness returns, it is strongly recommended that he be referred for a videostroboscopy prior to returning to additional outpatient therapy.,LONG-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient did reach his long-term goal of improved vocal quality to return to prior level of function and to utilize his voice in all settings without vocal hoarseness or difficulty.,2.  The patient appears very pleased with his return of his normal voice and feels that he no longer needs outpatient skilled speech therapy.,The patient is discharged from my services at this time with a home program to continue to promote normal voicing.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Bladder cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of gross hematuria.  The patient presented to the emergency room near his hometown on 12/24/2007 for evaluation of this gross hematuria.  CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall.  Urology referral was initiated and the patient was sent to be evaluated by Dr. X. He eventually underwent a bladder biopsy on 01/18/08, which demonstrated high-grade transitional cell carcinoma without any muscularis propria in the specimen.  Additionally, the patient underwent workup for a right adrenal lesion, which was noted on the initial CT scan.  This workup involved serum cortisol analysis as well as potassium and aldosterone and ACTH level measurement.  All of this workup was found to be grossly negative.  Secondary to the absence of muscle in the specimen, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 02/27/08 by Dr. X and the tumor was noted to be very large with significant tumor burden as well as possible involvement of the bladder neck.  At that time, the referring urologist determined the tumor to be too large and risky for local resection, and the patient was referred to ABCD Urology for management and diagnosis.  The patient presents today for evaluation by Dr. Y.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Includes condyloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication.

            "Note: REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Elevated PSA with nocturia and occasional daytime frequency.,HISTORY: , A 68-year-old male with a history of frequency and some outlet obstructive issues along with irritative issues.  The patient has had history of an elevated PSA and PSA in 2004 was 5.5.  In 2003, he had undergone a biopsy by Dr. X, which was negative for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  The patient has had PSAs as high as noted above.  His PSAs have been as low as 1.6, but those were on Proscar.  He otherwise appears to be doing reasonably well, off the Proscar, otherwise does have some irritative symptoms.  This has been ongoing for greater than five years.  No other associated symptoms or modifying factors.  Severity is moderate.  PSA relatively stable over time.,IMPRESSION: , Stable PSA over time, although he does have some irritative symptoms.  After our discussion, it does appear that if he is not drinking close to going to bed, he notes that his nocturia has significantly decreased.  At this juncture what I would like to do is to start with behavior modification.  There were no other associated symptoms or modifying factors.,PLAN: , The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed.  He already knows that this does decrease his nocturia.  He will do this without medications to see how well he does and hopefully he may need no other additional medications other than may be changing his alpha-blocker to something of more efficacious.\n",

Patient has had diagnosis of right breast cancer in 1984 with subsequent radiation therapy.  The patient's sister was also diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 59.,TECHNIQUE: , Standard digital mammographic imaging was performed.  The examination was performed with iCAD Second Look Version 7.2.,COMPARISON: , Most recently obtained __________.,FINDINGS: , The right breast is again smaller than the left.  There is a scar marker with underlying skin thickening and retraction along the upper margin of the right breast.  The breasts are again composed of a mixture of adipose tissue and a moderate amount of heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  There is again some coarsening of the right breast parenchyma with architectural distortion which is unchanged and most consistent with postsurgical and postradiation changes.  A few benign-appearing microcalcifications are present.,No dominant malignant-appearing mass lesion, developing area of architectural distortion or suspicious-appearing cluster of microcalcifications are identified.  The skin is stable.  No enlarged axillary lymph node is seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  No significant interval changes are seen.  No mammographic evidence of malignancy is identified.,2.  Annual screening mammography is recommended or sooner if clinical symptoms warrant.,BIRADS Classification 2 - Benign,MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:,1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.,2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.,3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was utilized.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient is a 49-year-old Caucasian male transported to the emergency room by his wife, complaining of shortness of breath.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is known by the nursing staff here to have a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. He has made multiple visits in the past. Today, the patient presents himself in severe respiratory distress. His wife states that since his recent admission of three weeks ago for treatment of pneumonia, he has not seemed to be able to recuperate, and has persistent complaints of shortness of breath.,Today, his symptoms worsened and she brought him to the emergency room. To the best of her knowledge, there has been no fever. He has persistent chronic cough, as always. More complete history cannot be taken because of the patient’s acute respiratory decompensation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Hypertension and emphysema.,MEDICATIONS:,  Lotensin and some water pill as well as, presumably, an Atrovent inhaler.,ALLERGIES:,  None are known.,HABITS:,  The patient is unable to cooperate with the history.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient lives in the local area with his wife.,REVIEW OF BODY SYSTEMS:,  Unable, secondary to the patient’s condition.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96 degrees, axillary. Pulse 128. Respirations 48. Blood pressure 156/100. Initial oxygen saturations on room air are 80.,GENERAL: Reveals a very anxious, haggard and exhausted-appearing male, tripoding, with labored breathing.,HEENT: Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.,NECK: The neck is supple without obvious jugular venous distention.,LUNGS: Auscultation of the chest reveals very distant and faint breath sounds, bilaterally, without obvious rales.,HEART: Cardiac examination reveals sinus tachycardia, without pronounced murmur.,ABDOMEN: Soft to palpation.,Extremities: Without edema.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:,  White blood count 25.5, hemoglobin 14, hematocrit 42.4, 89 polys, 1 band, 4 lymphocytes. Chemistry panel within normal limits, with the exception of sodium of 124, chloride 81, CO2 44, BUN 6, creatinine 0.7, glucose 182, albumin 3.3 and globulin 4.1. Troponin is 0.11. Urinalysis reveals yellow clear urine. Specific gravity greater than 1.030 with 2+ ketones, 1+ blood and 3+ protein. No white cells and 0-2 red cells.,Chest x-ray suboptimal in quality, but without obvious infiltrates, consolidation or pneumothorax.,CRITICAL CARE NOTE:,  Critical care one hour.,Shortly after the patient’s initial assessment, the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress. Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure. Given the patient’s white count and recent history of pneumonia, the possibility of recurrence of pneumonia is certainly there. Similarly, it would be difficult to rule out sepsis. Myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.,COORDINATION OF CARE:,  Dr. X was contacted from the emergency room and asked to assume the patient’s care in the Intensive Care Unit.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Respiratory failure secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:, The patient is to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY: , A 34-year-old male presents today self-referred at the recommendation of Emergency Room physicians and his nephrologist to pursue further allergy evaluation and treatment.  Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis times 2 years and a history of hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal dialysis.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.,ALLERGIES: , Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco or alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.,2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.,3.  Hypertension.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to the patient with further recommendations to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old male who was seen for evaluation at the request of Dr. X regarding recurrent jaw pain.  This patient has been having what he described as numbness and tingling along the jaw, teeth, and tongue.  This numbness has been present for approximately two months.  It seems to be there \"all the time.\"  He was seen by his dentist and after dental evaluation was noted to be \"okay.\"  He had been diagnosed with a throat infection about a week ago and is finishing a course of Avelox at this time.  He has been taking cough drops and trying to increase his fluids.  He has recently stopped tobacco.  He has been chewing tobacco for about 30 years.  Again, there is concern regarding the numbness he has been having.  He has had a loss of sensation of taste as well.  Numbness seems to be limited just to the left lateral tongue and the jaw region and extends from the angle of the jaw to the lip.  He does report he has had about a 20-pound of weight gain over the winter, but notes he has had this in the past just simply from decreased activity.  He has had no trauma to the face.  He does note a history of headaches.  These are occasional and he gets these within the neck area when they do flare up.  The headaches are noted to be less than one or two times per month.  The patient does note he has a history of anxiety disorder as well.  He has tried to eliminate his amount of tobacco and he is actually taking Nicorette gum at this time.  He denies any fever or chills.  He is not having any dental pain with biting down.  He has had no jaw popping and no trismus noted.

            "Note: REASON FOR EXAM:  This 60-year-old female who was found to have a solid indeterminate mass involving the inferior pole of the right kidney was referred for percutaneous biopsy under CT guidance at the request of Dr. X.,PROCEDURE:  The procedure risks and possible complications including, but not limited to severe hemorrhage which could result in emergent surgery, were explained to the patient.  The patient understood.  All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained.  With the patient in the prone position, noncontrasted CT localization images were obtained through the kidney.  Conscious sedation was utilized with the patient being monitored.  The patient was administered divided dose of Versed and fentanyl intravenously.,Following sterile preparation and local anesthesia to the posterior aspect of the right flank, an 18-gauge co-axial Temno-type needle was directed into the inferior pole right renal mass from the posterior oblique approach.  Two biopsy specimens were obtained and placed in 10% formalin solution.  CT documented needle placement.  Following the biopsy, there was active bleeding through the stylet, as well as a small hematoma about the inferior aspect of the right kidney posteriorly.  I placed several torpedo pledgets of Gelfoam through the co-axial sheath into the site of bleeding.  The bleeding stopped.  The co-axial sheath was then removed.  Bandage was applied.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  Postbiopsy CT images were then obtained.  The patient's hematoma appeared stable.  The patient was without complaints of pain or discomfort.  The patient was then sent to her room with plans of observing for approximately 4 hours and then to be discharged, as stable.  The patient was instructed to remain at bedrest for the remaining portions of the day at home and patient is to followup with Dr. Fieldstone for the results and follow-up care.,FINDINGS:  Initial noncontrasted CT localization images reveals the presence of an approximately 2.1 cm cortical mass involving the posterior aspect of the inferior pole of the right kidney.  Images obtained during the biopsy reveals the cutting portion of the biopsy needle to extend through the mass.  Images obtained following the biopsy reveals the development of a small hematoma posterior to the right kidney in its inferior pole adjacent to the mass.  There are small droplets of air within the hematoma.  No hydronephrosis is identified.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Percutaneous biopsy of inferior pole right renal mass under computed tomography guidance with specimen sent to laboratory in 10% formalin solution.,2.  Development of a small hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with active bleeding through the biopsy needle stopped by tract embolization with Gelfoam pledgets.\n",

            "Note: REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt \"just like the stroke.\"  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing \"mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,\" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only \"comes and goes.\",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test\n",

            "Note: IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT: , The patient is a 34-year-old Caucasian female.,CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Depression.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient's depression began in her teenage years.  Sleep has been poor, for multiple reasons.  She has obstructive sleep apnea, and has difficulties with a child who has insomnia related to medications that he takes.  The patient tends to feel irritable, and has crying spells.  She sometimes has problems with motivation.  She has problems with memory, and energy level is poor. Appetite has been poor, but without weight change.  Because of her frequent awakening, her CPAP machine monitor has indicated she is not using it enough, and Medicaid is threatening to refuse to pay for the machine.  She does not have suicidal thoughts.  ,The patient also has what she describes as going into a \"panic mode.\"  During these times, she feels as if her whole body is going to explode.  She has a hard time taking a deep breath, her heart rate goes up, blood pressure is measured as higher shortly afterward, and she gets a sense of impending doom.  These spells may last a couple of hours, but once lasted for about two day.  She does not get chest pain.  These attacks tend to be precipitated by bills that cannot be paid, or being on a \"time crunch.\" ,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  The patient's nurse practitioner had started her on Cymbalta, up to 60 mg per day. This was helpful, but then another physician switched her to Wellbutrin in the hope that this would help her quit smoking.  Although she was able to cut down on tobacco usage, the depression has been more poorly controlled.  She has used Wellbutrin up to 200 mg b.i.d. and Cymbalta up to 60 mg per day, at different times.  At age 13, the patient cut her wrists because of issues with a boyfriend, and as she was being sutured she realized that this was a very stupid thing to do.  She has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes.  She did see a psychologist at age 16 briefly because of prior issues in her life, but she did not fully reveal information, and it was deemed that she did not need services.  She has not previously spoken with a psychiatrist, but has been seeing a therapist, Stephanie Kitchen, at this facility.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,Caffeine:  The patient has two or three drinks per day of tea or Diet Pepsi.,Tobacco:  She smokes about one pack of cigarettes per week since being on Wellbutrin, and prior to that time had been smoking one-half pack per day.  She is still committed to quitting.,Alcohol: Denied.,Illicit drugs:  Denied.  In her earlier years, someone once put some unknown drug in her milk, and she \"came to\" when she was dancing on the table in front of the school nurse.,MEDICAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,Constitutional:  See History of Present Illness. No recent fever or sweats.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY: , The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005.  She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved.  Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain.  She has been extensively worked up and treated for this.  MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal.  She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain.  In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated.  She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face.  By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg.  Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved.  However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg.  The face numbness has completely resolved.  Symptoms are mild.  She denies any previous similar episodes.  She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function.  There is no associated headache.,Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination.  Normal gait.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation.  She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot.  In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick.  She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: , Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.,NEEDLE EMG: , Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is normal.  There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy.  EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident.  This was normal.,Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year.  Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms.  Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results.\n",

The patient is not a great historian.  Most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her.  According to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001.  She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr.  A in August 2001.  It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.  Postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past.\n",

The patient became concerned and came into the emergency department. ,Here in the emergency department, the patient states that his pain is a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10. He feels much more comfortable. He denies any shortness of breath or dizziness, and states that the pain feels unlike the pain of his myocardial infarction. The patient has no other complaints at this time. ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, The patient's past medical history is significant for status post myocardial infarction in February of 1995 and again in late February of 1995. Both were related to illegal use of amphetamines. ,ALLERGIES:, None. ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, Include nitroglycerin p.r.n. ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 131/76, pulse 50, respirations 18, temperature 96.5. ,GENERAL: The patient is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress. The patient is alert and oriented x 3 and lying comfortably on the bed. ,HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive. Extraocular movements are intact. ,NECK: Supple with full range of motion. No rigidity or meningismus. ,CHEST: Nontender. ,LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. ,HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur, S3, or S4. ,ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended, nontender with active bowel sounds. No masses or organomegaly. No costovertebral angle tenderness. ,EXTREMITIES: Unremarkable. ,NEUROLOGIC: Unremarkable. ,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT LABS:, The patient had a CBC, minor chemistry, and cardiac enzymes, all within normal limits. Chest x-ray, as read by me, was normal. Electrocardiogram, as read by me, showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST or T-wave segment changes. There were no acute changes seen on the electrocardiogram. O2 saturation, as interpreted by me, is 99%. ,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: ,The patient had a stable, uncomplicated emergency department course. The patient received 45 cc of Mylanta and 10 cc of viscous lidocaine with complete relief of his chest pain. The patient had no further complaints and stated that he felt much better shortly thereafter. ,AFTERCARE AND DISPOSITION: ,The patient was discharged from the emergency department in stable, ambulatory, good condition with instructions to use Mylanta for his abdominal pain and to follow up with his regular doctor in the next one to two days. Otherwise, return to the emergency department as needed for any problem. The patient was given a copy of his labs and his electrocardiogram. The patient was advised to decrease his level of activity until then. The patient left with final diagnosis of: ,FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ,1. Evaluation of chest pain. ,2. Possible esophageal reflux.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  A 50-year-old female comes to the clinic with complaint of mood swings and tearfulness.  This has been problematic over the last several months and is just worsening to the point where it is impairing her work.  Her boss asks her if she was actually on drugs in which she said no.  She stated may be she needed to be, meaning taking some medications.  The patient had been prescribed Wellbutrin in the past and responded well to it; however, at that time it was prescribed for obsessive-compulsive type disorder relating to overeating and therefore her insurance would not cover the medication.  She has not been on any other antidepressants in the past.  She is not having any suicidal ideation but is having difficulty concentrating, rapid mood swings with tearfulness, and insomnia.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats.  She underwent TAH with BSO in December of 2003.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Benign breast lump in her mother; however, her paternal grandmother had breast cancer.  The patient denies any palpitations, urinary incontinence, hair loss, or other concerns.  She was recently treated for sinusitis.,ALLERGIES:,  She is allergic to Sulfa.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Recently finished Minocin and Duraphen II DM.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  A well-developed and well-nourished female, conscious, alert, oriented times three in no acute distress.  Mood is dysthymic.  Affect is tearful.,Skin:  Without rash.,Eyes:  PERRLA.  Conjunctivae are clear.,Neck:  Supple with adenopathy or thyromegaly.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Postsurgical menopause.,2.  Mood swings.,PLAN:,  I spent about 30 minutes with the patient discussing treatment options.  I do believe that her moods would greatly benefit from hormone replacement therapy; however, she is reluctant to do this because of family history of breast cancer.  We will try starting her back on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg daily.  She may increase to 300 mg daily after three to seven days.  Samples provided initially.  If she is not obtaining adequate relief from medication alone, we will then suggest that we explore the use of hormone replacement therapy.  I also recommended increasing her exercise.  We will also obtain some screening lab work including CBC, UA, TSH, chemistry panel, and lipid profile.  Follow up here in two weeks or sooner if any other problems.  She is needing her annual breast exam as well.\n",

            "Note: As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant.,Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk.  She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall.  She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests.  She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made.,The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved.  She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.,In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia.  She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing.  She was diagnosed as having \"overactive bladder\", but the cause of this was never determined.  She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit.  She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.,Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable \"stiffness\" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles.  Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others.  She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was \"not arthritis\", but no definite diagnosis was ever established.  She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal.  No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.,However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat.  She states from time-to-time she could \"barely walk\".  She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were \"walking on stilts\".  She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit.  She began to tire more easily when walking.,In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.,In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X.  He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine.  He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing.  After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis.  However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003.  Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.,The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex.  She continued on it for about six months.  However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it.  She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy.  So, she discontinued it also.,At that point in time, she decided to try a program of \"good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil\".,In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities.  She began to have to use a cane.  She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z.  She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak.  Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically.  However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.,She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005).  This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial.  However, it wore off once again.,A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to \"look better\".  She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.,Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets.  She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs.  She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.,She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.,The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability.  There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Essentially noncontributory.,ALLERGIES:,  The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN.  She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She does not smoke.  She takes one glass of wine per day.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has not had any prior surgeries.  Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:,  The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet.  There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum.  There appear to be Dawson's fingers.  The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.,Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05.  The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.,However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal.  Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord.  It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5ºF, and weight 124 lb (dressed).,General:  Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.,Head:  Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.,Neck:  Supple, with full range of motion.  No spasm or tenderness.  Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits.  No thyromegaly or adenopathy.,Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity.  Range of motion full throughout.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:,Mental Status:  Awake, alert, oriented to time, place, and person; appropriate.  Recent and remote memory intact.  No evidence of right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia.,CRANIAL NERVES,:,II:  Visual fields full to confrontation.  Fundi benign.,III, IV, VI:  Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus.  No ptosis.

Motor function normal.,VII:  No facial asymmetry.,VIII:  Hears finger rub bilaterally.  Weber and Rinne tests normal.,IX & X:  Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation.  Gag reflex equal bilaterally.,XI:  Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally.,XII:  Tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations.  Rapid alternating movements normal.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Tone, bulk, and strength are normal in both upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, there is moderate spasticity on the right and moderately severe spasticity on the left.  There are bilateral Achilles' contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture.,Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left):  Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5.  There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements.\n",

            "Note: Chief Complaint:, Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.,History of Present Illness:, A 50-year-old Asian female comes to The Methodist Hospital on January 2, 2001, complaining of a 3-day history of abdominal pain. The pain is described as crampy in the central part of her abdomen, and is associated with nausea and vomiting during the previous 24 hours. The patient denied passing any stool or gas per rectum for the previous 24 hours. She had been admitted recently to the hospital from December 19 to December 23, 2000, with a three-week history of fevers to 101.8, diaphoresis, anorexia, malaise and skin \"lumps\". She described a total of three \"lumps\". The first one started as a pin-sized lesion that grew up and then disappeared, the other two didn't resolve. They were described as \"erythematous nodular lesions on the extensor surface of the left arm.\" A punch biopsy was obtained from these skin lesions, showing deep dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue that contained \"multiple granulomas composed of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without caseating necrosis\". However, one granuloma in the deep dermis, showed a hint of central necrosis. Special stains for acid - fast bacilli and fungi were reported as negative. No atypia or malignancy was noted. A CT scan of the chest was obtained on December 19, 2000 and showed numerous masses with spiculated borders bilaterally, predominately in the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes. No cavitary lesions, mediastinal masses or definite hilar adenopathy were reported. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy which showed fragments of bronchial mucosa and wall with underlying lung parenchyma. Minimal to mild interstitial lymphocytes with a few microfoci of neutrophils were seen. They were also able to appreciate intra-alveolar fibrinous exudates.

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.  The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.,HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.,PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.,LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.\n",

Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.  ,OBJECTIVE: , The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15.  Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact.  Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities.  Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception.  Cerebellar exam is intact.  Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes.  Speech is appropriate.  Judgment is intact.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme.  We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing.  Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma.  The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor.  He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night.  He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning.  He has undergone vocational rehab assessment.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  The patient is a very pleasant 44-year-old white female quite obese.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  122/70.  Temperature:  98.6.,HEENT:  Head:  Normocephalic.  Ears:  TMs intact.  Eyes:  Pupils round, and equal.  Nose:  Mucosa normal.  Throat:  Mucosa normal.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft and obese.,Extremities:  A lot of fluid in both legs, but especially the left leg is really swollen.  At least 2+ pedal edema.  The right leg just has a trace of edema.  She has pain in her low back with range of motion.  She has a lot of pain in her left shoulder with range of motion.  It is hard for her to get her hand behind her back.  She cannot get it up behind her head.  She has pain in the anterior left shoulder in that area.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Multiple problems including left leg swelling.,2.  History of leukocytosis.,3.  Joint pain involving the left shoulder, probably impingement syndrome.,4.  Low back pain, chronic with obesity.,5.  Obesity.,6.  Frequency with urination.,7.  Tobacco abuse.,PLAN:,1.  I will schedule for a venous Doppler of the left leg and will have her come back in the morning for a CBC and a metabolic panel.  We will start her on Detrol 0.4 mg one daily and also started on Mobic 15 mg per day.,2.  Elevate her leg as much as possible and wear support hose if possible.  Keep her foot up during the day.  We will see her back in two weeks.  We will have the results of the Doppler, the lab work and see how she is doing with the Detrol and the joint pain.  If her shoulder pain is not any better, we probably should refer her on over to orthopedist.  We did do x-rays of her shoulder today that did not show anything remarkable.  See her in two weeks or p.r.n.\n",

            "Note: MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Strokes.,SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY DIAGNOSIS:  ,Global aphasia.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient is a 44-year-old female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often \"no.\"  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded \"no\" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered \"no\" to all \"yes/no\" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated \"I can't\".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple \"yes/no\" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Recurrent dizziness x1 month.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems including CHF (O2 dependent), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, possible stroke, multiple joint disease including gout, arthritis, both rheumatoid and DJD, who presents with a complaint of one month of dizziness.  She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place.  She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.  She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left.  She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up.  She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches.  She also notes occasional tinnitus to her right ear.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  CHF (uses portable oxygen).,2.  Atrial fibrillation.,3.  Gout.,4.  Arthritis (DJD/rheumatoid).,5.  Diabetes mellitus.,6.  Hypothyroidism.,7.  Hypertension.,8.  GERD.,9.  Possible stroke treated in 2003 at University of Maryland with acute onset of presyncopal sensations, sharp pains in the left side of her head and right-sided hemiparesis and numbness.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She is married.  She does not smoke, use alcohol or use illicit drugs.,MEDICATIONS: , Please see medication sheet in the chart.  It includes potassium, Pravachol, Prevacid, Synthroid, Diovan, Amaryl, Vitamin B12, Coreg, Coumadin, furosemide, Actos, aspirin, colchicine, Cipro, Percocet, Ultram (has held the latter two medications for the past two weeks due to concerns of exacerbating dizziness).,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Please see note in chart essentially entirely positive including cardiovascular problems of shortness of breath, PND and palpitations, chronic lack of energy, weight gain, the dizziness for which she presented.  Tinnitus in the right ear.  Diabetes and hypothyroidism.  Chronic nausea.  Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back.  Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking.  She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious.  She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply.  She also endorses poor sleep.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Weight is 257 pounds.  Pain scale is 7.,GENERAL:  This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination.  It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw.  She is obese.,HEENT:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally.  There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region.  There are no palpable cervical nodes.,NECK:  Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,HEART:  Heart sounds are distant.  There are no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:,MENTAL STATUS:  She is alert and oriented x3.  Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential.  She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.,MOTOR:  This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity.  There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout.  Her tone is normal throughout.,SENSORY:  She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg.  She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.,COORDINATION:  There is no obvious dysmetria.,GAIT:  She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker.  There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present.,REFLEXES:  Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent.  Toes are equivocal.,OTHER:  Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, \"Oh my back, oh my back\", and was unable to complete the maneuver.  Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology.  Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.,We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert.\n",

            "Note: INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:, A 51-year-old, obese, white female with positive family history of coronary disease and history of chest radiation for Hodgkin disease 20 years ago with no other identifiable risk factors who presents with an acute myocardial infarction with elevated enzymes. The chest pain occurred early Tuesday morning. She was treated with Plavix, Lovenox, etc., and transferred for coronary angiography and possible PCI. The plan was discussed with the patient and all questions answered.,PROCEDURE NOTE:, Following sterile prep and drape, the right groin and instillation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was percutaneously entered with a single wall puncture. A 6-French sheath inserted. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricle pressures, and a left ventriculography. The left pullback pressure. The catheters withdrawn. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. She tolerated the procedure well.,Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure equals 25 mmHg post A wave. No aortic valve or systolic gradient on pullback.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is,normal. The left anterior descending extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the midportion of the vessel. Normal diagonal branches. Normal septal perforator branches. The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches.,II. Right coronary artery: The proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification. There is minor plaque with luminal irregularity in the proximal and midportion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most. The right coronary artery is a dominant system which gives off normal posterior,descending and posterior lateral branches. TIMI 3 flow is present.,III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is slightly enlarged with normal contraction of the base, but, with wall motion abnormality involving the anteroapical and inferoapical left ventricle with hypokinesis within the apical portion. Ejection fraction estimated 40%, 1+ mitral regurgitation (echocardiogram ordered).,DISCUSSION:, Recent inferoapical mild myocardial infarction by left ventriculography and cardiac enzymes with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure post A wave, but, only minor residual coronary artery plaque with calcification proximal right coronary artery.,PLAN:, Medical treatment is contemplated, including ACE inhibitor, a beta blocker, aspirin, Plavix, nitrates. An echocardiogram is ordered to exclude apical left ventricular thrombus and to further assess ejection fraction.\n",

Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis.  Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound.  She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm.  She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct.  She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP.  On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture.  Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization.  She was also noted to have an elevated CA99.  She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation.  After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia.  She has two adult sons who are in good health.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years.  Her first husband died in 1995.  She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed.  She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well.  She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms.  As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup.  She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.  She has had loose stools.  The rest of her review of systems is negative.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,VITALS:\n",

            "Note: EXAM:,MRI LEFT FOOT,CLINICAL:, A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon.,FINDINGS:,Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005.,There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle.,There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains.,There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position.

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 50-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on June 22, 2007.  The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Endstage renal disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Endstage renal disease.,PROCEDURE:,  Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 400 mL.,FLUIDS:  ,One liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,SPECIMEN:  ,None.,DRAIN: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.  Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check.  The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work.  She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY: , The patient is a 48-year-old female who was seen in consultation requested from Dr. X on 05/28/2008 regarding chronic headaches and pulsatile tinnitus.  The patient reports she has been having daily headaches since 02/25/2008.  She has been getting pulsations in the head with heartbeat sounds.  Headaches are now averaging about three times per week.  They are generally on the very top of the head according to the patient.  Interestingly, she denies any previous significant history of headaches prior to this.  There has been no nausea associated with the headaches.  The patient does note that when she speaks on the phone, the left ear has \"weird sounds.\"  She feels a general fullness in the left ear.  She does note pulsation sounds within that left ear only.  This began on February 17th according to the patient.  The patient reports that the ear pulsations began following an air flight to Iowa where she was visiting family.  The patient does admit that the pulsations in the ears seem to be somewhat better over the past few weeks.  Interestingly, there has been no significant drop or change in her hearing.  She does report she has had dizzy episodes in the past with nausea, being off balance at times.  It is not associated with the pulsations in the ear.  She does admit the pulsations will tend to come and go and there had been periods where the pulsations have completely cleared in the ear.  She is denying any vision changes.  The headaches are listed as moderate to severe in intensity on average about three to four times per week.  She has been taking Tylenol and Excedrin to try to control the headaches and that seems to be helping somewhat.  The patient presents today for further workup, evaluation, and treatment of the above-listed symptoms.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , ,ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGIC:  Negative.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Hypercholesterolemia.,PULMONARY:  Negative.,GASTROINTESTINAL:  Pertinent for nausea.,GENITOURINARY:  The patient is noted to be a living kidney donor and has only one kidney.,NEUROLOGIC:  History of dizziness and the headaches as listed above.,VISUAL:  Negative.,DERMATOLOGIC:  History of itching.  She has also had a previous history of skin cancer on the arm and back.,ENDOCRINE:  Negative.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Negative.,CONSTITUTIONAL:  She has had an increased weight gain and fatigue over the past year.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  She has had a left nephrectomy, C-sections, mastoidectomy, laparoscopy, and T&A.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Father, history of cancer, hypertension, and heart disease.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Tylenol, Excedrin, and she is on multivitamin and probiotic's.,ALLERGIES: , She is allergic to codeine and penicillin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She is married.  She works at Eye Center as a receptionist.  She denies tobacco at this time though she was a previous smoker, stopped four years ago, and she denies alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 120/78, pulse 64 and regular, and the temperature is 97.4.,GENERAL:  The patient is an alert, cooperative, well-developed 48-year-old female with a normal-sounding voice and good memory.,HEAD & FACE:  Inspected with no scars, lesions or masses noted.  Sinuses palpated and are normal.  Salivary glands also palpated and are normal with no masses noted.  The patient also has full facial function.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.,RESPIRATORY:  Lungs auscultated and noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezing or rubs and normal respiratory effort.,EYES:  Extraocular muscles were tested and within normal limits.,EARS:  There is an old mastoidectomy scar, left ear.  The ear canals are clean and dry.  Drums intact and mobile.  Weber exam is midline.  Grossly hearing is intact.  Please note audiologist not available at today's visit for further audiologic evaluation.,NASAL:  Reveals clear drainage.  Deviated nasal septum to the left, listed as mild to moderate.  Ostiomeatal complexes are patent and turbinates are healthy.  There was no mass or neoplasm within the nasopharynx noted on fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy.  See fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy separate exam.,ORAL:  Oral cavity is normal with good moisture.  Lips, teeth and gums are normal.  Evaluation of the oropharynx reveals normal mucosa, normal palates, and posterior oropharynx.  Examination of the larynx with a mirror reveals normal epiglottis, false and true vocal cords with good mobility of the cords.  The nasopharynx was briefly examined by mirror with normal appearing mucosa, posterior choanae and eustachian tubes.,NECK:  The neck was examined with normal appearance.  Trachea in the midline.  The thyroid was normal, nontender, with no palpable masses or adenopathy noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII evaluated and noted to be normal.  Patient oriented times 3.,DERMATOLOGIC:  Evaluation reveals no masses or lesions.  Skin turgor is normal.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Pulsatile tinnitus, left ear with eustachian tube disorder as the etiology.  Consider, also normal pressure hydrocephalus.,2.  Recurrent headaches.,3.  Deviated nasal septum.,4.  Dizziness, again also consider possible Meniere disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I did recommend the patient begin a 2 g or less sodium diet.  I have also ordered a carotid ultrasound study as part of the workup and evaluation.  She has had a recent CAT scan of the brain though this was without contrast.  It did reveal previous mastoidectomy, left temporal bone, but no other mass noted.  I have started her on Nasacort AQ nasal spray one spray each nostril daily as this is eustachian tube related.  Hearing protection devices should be used at all times as well.  I did counsel the patient if she has any upcoming airplane trips to use nasal decongestant or topical nasal decongestant spray prior to boarding the plane, and also using the airplane ear plugs as these can be effective at helping to prevent eustachian tube issues.  I am going to recheck her in three weeks.  If the pulsatile tinnitus at that time is not clear, we have discussed other treatment options including myringotomy or ear tube placement, which could be done here in the office.  She will be scheduled for a audio and tympanogram to be done as well prior to that procedure.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.,PLAN: , My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.,\n",

The patient was intubated and it was felt that she should be observed to see if the airway would improve upon which she could be extubated.  If not she would require tracheostomy.  The patient was treated with IV antibiotics and ventilatory support and at the time of this dictation, she has recently been taken to the operating room where it was felt that the airway sufficient and she was extubated.  She was doing well with good p.o.s, good airway, good voice, and desiring to be discharged home.  So, the patient is being prepared for discharge at this point.  We will have Dr. X evaluate her before she leaves to make sure I do not have any problem with her going home.  Dr. Y feels she could be discharged today and will have her return to see him in a week.\n",

She denies any weakness.  No significant neck pain, change in bowel or bladder symptoms, change in gait, or similar symptoms in the past.  She is on Lyrica for the pain, which has been somewhat successful.,Examination reveals positive Phalen's test on the left.  Remainder of her neurological examination is normal.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:  ,The left median motor distal latency is prolonged with normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity.  The left median sensory distal latency is prolonged with an attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The right median sensory distal latency is mildly prolonged with a mildly attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The right median motor distal latency and evoked response amplitude is normal.  Left ulnar motor and sensory and left radial sensory responses are normal.  Left median F-wave is normal.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed on the left arm, right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles.  It revealed spontaneous activity in the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle.  There is increased insertional activity in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle.  Both interosseous muscles showed signs of reinnervation.  Left extensor digitorum communis muscle showed evidence of reduced recruitment.  Cervical paraspinal muscles were normal.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:  A left median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.  Electrical abnormalities are moderate-to-mild bilateral C8 radiculopathies.  This may be an incidental finding.,I have recommended MRI of the spine without contrast and report will be sent to Dr. XYZ.  She will follow up with Dr. XYZ with respect to treatment of the above conditions.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY:,  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves.  Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago.  This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time.  She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms.  She is almost asymptomatic at present.  She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs.  She has had no associated weakness.,On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal.  The patient is obese.  There is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities.  Strength is full and symmetric.  Deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2+ and symmetric and absent at the ankles.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: , Bilateral sural sensory responses are absent.  Bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced.  The right radial sensory response is normal.  The right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal.  Bilateral H-reflexes are absent.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle.  Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment.,IMPRESSION:  ,This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy.,2.  Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies.  Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil.  I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return.  With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes.  However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following:  Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer.\n",

            "Note: SUBJECTIVE: , The patient is a 60-year-old female, who complained of coughing during meals.  Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,OBJECTIVE: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,ASSESSMENT,ORAL STAGE:,  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,  No aspiration was noted during this evaluation.  Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid.  The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: ,Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.,PLAN: , Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:,1.  The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.,3.  The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.,The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services.\n",

            "Note: CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Transient visual loss lasting five minutes.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a very active and pleasant 82-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for first-degree AV block, status post pacemaker placement, hypothyroidism secondary to hyperthyroidism and irradiation, possible lumbar stenosis.  He reports he experienced a single episode of his vision decreasing \"like it was compressed from the top down with a black sheet coming down\".  The episode lasted approximately five minutes and occurred three weeks ago while he was driving a car.  He was able to pull the car over to the side of the road safely.  During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded.  His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode.  He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable.  It was suggested at that time that he get a CT angiogram since he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker.  He has had no further similar events.  He denies any lesions or other visual change, focal weakness or sensory change, headaches, gait change or other neurological problem.,He also reports that he has been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis based on some mild difficulty arising from a chair for which an outside physician ordered a CT of his L-spine that reportedly showed lumbar stenosis.  The question has arisen as to whether he should have a CT myelogram to further evaluate this process.  He has no back pain or pain of any type, he denies bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness.  He is extremely active and plays tennis at least three times a week.  He denies recent episodes of unexpected falls.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He only endorses hypothyroidism, the episode of visual loss described above and joint pain.  He also endorses having trouble getting out of a chair, but otherwise his review of systems is negative.  A copy is in his clinic chart.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As above.  He has had bilateral knee replacement three years ago and experiences some pain in his knees with this.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is retired from the social security administration x 20 years.  He travels a lot and is extremely active.  He does not smoke.  He consumes alcohol socially only.  He does not use illicit drugs.  He is married.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient has recently been started on Plavix by his primary care doctor, was briefly on baby aspirin 81 mg per day since the TIA-like event three weeks ago.  He also takes Proscar 5 mg q.d and Synthroid 0.2 mg q.d.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  BP 134/80, heart rate 60, respiratory rate 16, and weight 244 pounds.  He denies any pain.,General:  This is a pleasant white male in no acute distress.,HEENT:  He is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  There is no sinus tenderness.,Neck:  Supple.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  There are no bruits present.,Extremities:  Extremities are warm and dry.  Distal pulses are full.  There is no edema.,NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:,MENTAL STATUS:  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with good recent and long-term memory.  His language is fluent.  His attention and concentration are good.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  VFFTC, PERRL, EOMI, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, hearing is decreased on the right (hearing aid), palate rises symmetrically, shoulder shrug is strong, tongue protrudes in the midline.,MOTOR:  He has normal bulk and tone throughout.  There is no cogwheeling.  There is some minimal weakness at the iliopsoas bilaterally 4+/5 and possibly trace weakness at the quadriceps -5/5.  Otherwise he is 5/5 throughout including hip adductors and abductors.,SENSORY:  He has decreased sensation to vibration and proprioception to the middle of his feet only, otherwise sensory is intact to light touch, and temperature, pinprick, proprioception and vibration.,COORDINATION:  There is no dysmetria or tremor noted.  His Romberg is negative.  Note that he cannot rise from the chair without using his arms.,GAIT:  Upon arising, he has a normal step, stride, and toe, heel.  He has difficulty with tandem and tends to fall to the left.,REFLEXES:  2 at biceps, triceps, patella and 1 at ankles.,The patient provided a CT scan without contrast from his previous hospitalization three weeks ago, which is normal to my inspection.,He has had full labs for cholesterol and stroke for risk factors although he does not have those available here.,IMPRESSION:,1.  TIA.  The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation.  Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection.  He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system.  He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued.  Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup.  The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time.,2.  Lumbar stenosis.  His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability.  In the absence of motor stabilizing symptoms, the patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time.  Therefore we would defer further evaluation with CT myelogram as he does not want surgery.,PLAN:,1.  We will get a CT angiogram of the cerebral vessels.,2.  Continue Plavix.,3.  Obtain copies of the workup done at the outside hospital.,4.  We will follow the lumbar stenosis for the time being.  No further workup is planned.\n",

Metastatic breast cancer.,6.  Increased liver function tests.  Given her bone metastasis, the elevated alkaline phosphatase may be from this as opposed to underlying liver disease.,7.  Chronic constipation.,8.  Acute renal failure.,PLAN:  ,The patient will be on a clear liquid diet.  She will continue on the Zofran.  She will be on IV Protonix.  The patient is going to be transfused packed red blood cells and her hemoglobin and hematocrit will be monitored.  I obtained the result of the abdominal x-rays she had done through the ER.  The patient has a consult pending with the oncologist to see what her PET scan show.  There is a renal consult pending.  I am going to have her get a total abdominal ultrasound to see if there is any evidence of liver metastasis and also to assess her kidneys.  Her laboratory studies will be followed.  Based upon the patient's medical condition and including her laboratory studies including a platelet count, we talked about EGD versus upper GI workup per upper GI symptoms.  I discussed informed consent for EGD.  I discussed the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  The risks reviewed included, but were not limited to an allergic reaction or side effect to medicines, cardiopulmonary complications, bleeding, infection, perforation, and needing to get admitted for antibiotics or blood transfusion or surgery.  The patient voices her understanding of the above.  She wants to think about what she wants to do.  Overall, this is a very ill patient with multiorgan involvement.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.,The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Patient is a 76-year-old white male who presents with his wife stating that he was stung by a bee on his right hand, left hand, and right knee at approximately noon today.  He did not note any immediate reaction.  Since that time, he has noted some increasing redness and swelling to his left hand, but he denies any generalized symptoms such as itching, hives, or shortness of breath.  He denies any sensation of tongue swelling or difficulty swallowing.,The patient states he was stung approximately one month ago without any serious reaction.  He did windup taking Benadryl at that time.  He has not taken anything today for his symptoms, but he is on hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol for hypertension as well as a baby aspirin each day.,ALLERGIES: , HE DOES HAVE MEDICATION INTOLERANCES TO SULFA DRUGS (HEADACHE), MORPHINE (NAUSEA AND VOMITING), AND TORADOL (ULCER).,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient is married and is a nonsmoker and lives with his wife, who is here with him.,Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp and vital signs are all within normal limits.,GENERAL:  In general, the patient is an elderly white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.,HEENT:  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The face shows no edema.  The tongue is not swollen and the airway is widely patent.,NECK:  No stridor.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.,EXTREMITIES:  Upper extremities, there is some edema and erythema to the dorsum of the left hand in the region of the distal third to fifth metacarpals.  There was some slight edema of the fourth digit, on which he still is wearing his wedding band.  The right hand shows no reaction.  The right knee is not swollen either.,The left fourth digit was wrapped in a rubber tourniquet to express the edema and using some Surgilube, I was able to remove his wedding band without any difficulty.  Patient was given Claritin 10 mg orally for what appears to be a simple local reaction to an insect sting.  I did explain to him that his swelling and redness may progress over the next few days.,ASSESSMENT: , Local reaction secondary to insect sting.,PLAN: , The patient was reassured that this is not a serious reaction to an insect sting and he should not progress to such a reaction.  I did urge him to use Claritin 10 mg once daily until the redness and swelling has gone.  I did explain that the swelling may worsen over the next two to three days, it may produce a large local reaction, but that anti-histamines were still the mainstay of therapy for such a reaction.  If he is not improved in the next four days, follow up with his PCP for a re-exam.\n",

He has had several cases of this in the past and he says that is usually takes quite awhile for him to get over it; he said that the last time he was here he got a steroid injection by Dr. Blackman; it looked like it was Depo-Medrol 80 mg.  He said that it worked fairly well, although it seemed to still take awhile to get rid of it.  He has been using over-the-counter Benadryl as well as cortisone cream on the areas of the rash and having a little bit of improvement, but this last weekend he must have gotten into some more poison ivy because he has got another outbreak along his chest, legs, arms and back.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Temperature is 99.2.  His weight is 207 pounds.,Skin:  Examination reveals a raised, maculopapular rash in kind of a linear pattern over his arms, legs and chest area which are consistent with a poison ivy or a poison oak.,ASSESSMENT AND ,PLAN:,  Poison ivy.  Plan would be Solu-Medrol 125 mg IM X 1.  Continue over-the-counter Benadryl or Rx allergy medicine that he was given the last time he was here, which is a one-a-day allergy medicine; he can not exactly remember what it is, which would also be fine rather than the over-the-counter Benadryl if he would like to use that instead.\n",

The patient is a very poor historian and is extremely hard of hearing, and therefore, very little history is available. She was found by EMS sitting on the toilet having diarrhea, and apparently had also just vomited. Upon my questioning of the patient, she can confirm that she has been sick to her stomach and has vomited. She cannot tell me how many times. She is also unable to describe the vomitus. She also tells me that her belly has been hurting. I am unable to get any further history from the patient because, again, she is an extremely poor historian and very hard of hearing.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Per the ER documentation is hypertension, diverticulosis, blindness, and sciatica.,MEDICATIONS:, Lorazepam 0.5 mg, dosing interval is not noted; Tylenol PM; Klor-Con 10 mEq; Lexapro; calcium with vitamin D.,ALLERGIES:, SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Unknown.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Also unknown.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Unobtainable secondary to the patient's condition.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Pulse 80.

No lower extremity edema.,GI: Mild epigastric tenderness to palpation without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normoactive.,RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with a normal effort.,SKIN: Warm, dry, no erythema.,NEUROLOGICAL: The patient attempts to answer questions when asked, but is very hard of hearing. She is seen to move all extremities spontaneously.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:, White count 9.6, hemoglobin 15.9, hematocrit 48.2, platelet count 345, PTT 24, PT 13.3, INR 0.99, sodium 135, potassium 3.3, chloride 95, bicarb 20, BUN 54, creatinine 2.2, glucose 165, calcium 10.3, magnesium 2.5, total protein 8.2, albumin 3.8, AST 33, ALT 26, alkaline phosphatase 92. Cardiac isoenzymes negative x1. EKG shows sinus rhythm with a rate of 96 and a prolonged QT interval.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1. Pancreatitis. Will treat symptomatically with morphine and Zofran, and also IV fluids. Will keep NPO.,2. Diarrhea. Will check stool studies.,3. Volume depletion. IV fluids.,4. Hyperglycemia. It is unknown whether the patient is diabetic. I will treat her with sliding scale insulin.,5. Hypertension. If the patient takes blood pressure medications, it is not listed on the only medication listing that is available. I will prescribe clonidine as needed.,6. Renal failure. Her baseline is unknown. This is at least partly prerenal. Will replace volume with IV fluids and monitor her renal function.,7. Hypokalemia. Will replace per protocol.,8. Hypercalcemia. This is actually rather severe when adjusted for the patient's low albumin. Her true calcium level comes out to somewhere around 12. For now, I will just treat her with IV fluids and Lasix, and monitor her calcium level.,9. Protein gap. This, in combination with the calcium, may be suggestive of multiple myeloma. It is my understanding that the family is seeking hospice placement for the patient right now. I would have to discuss with the family before undertaking any workup for multiple myeloma or other malignancy.\n",

            "Note: HISTORY: , The patient is to come to the hospital for bilateral L5 kyphoplasty.  The patient is an 86-year-old female with an L5 compression fracture.,The patient has a history of back and buttock pain for some time.  She was found to have an L5 compression fracture.  She was treated conservatively over several months, but did not improve.  Unfortunately, she has continued to have significant ongoing back pain and recent CT scan has shown a sclerosis with some healing of her L5 compression fracture, but without complete healing.  The patient has had continued pain and at this time, is felt to be a candidate for kyphoplasty.,She denies bowel or bladder incontinence.  She does complain of back pain.  She has been wearing a back brace and corset.  She does not have weakness.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  The patient has a history of multiple medical problems including hypothyroidism, hypertension, and gallbladder difficulties.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  She has had multiple previous surgeries including bowel surgery, hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and appendectomy.  She also has a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , She is on multiple medications currently.,ALLERGIES: , SHE IS ALLERGIC TO CODEINE, PENICILLIN, AND CEPHALOSPORINS.,FAMILY HISTORY: , The patient's parents are deceased.,PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives locally.  She is a widow.  She does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly frail white female in no distress.  LUNGS:  Clear.  HEART:  Sounds are regular.  ABDOMEN:  She has a protuberant abdomen.  She has tenderness to palpation in the lumbosacral area.  Sciatic notch tenderness is not present.  Straight leg raise testing evokes back pain.  NEUROLOGICAL:  She is awake, alert, and oriented.  Speech is intact.  Comprehension is normal.  Strength is intact in the upper extremities.  She has giveaway strength in the lower extremities.  Reflexes are diminished at the knees and ankles.  Gait is otherwise normal.,DATA REVIEWED: , Plain studies of the lumbar spine show an L5 compression fracture.  A CT scan has shown some healing of this fracture.  She has degenerative change at the L4-L5 level with a very slight spondylolisthesis at this level.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , The patient is a woman with a history of longstanding back, buttock, and leg pain.  She has a documented L5 compression fracture, which has not healed despite appropriate conservative treatments.  At this point, I believe the patient is a good candidate for L5 kyphoplasty.  I have discussed the procedure with her and I have reviewed with her and her family risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery.  Risks of surgery including but not limited to bleeding, infection, stroke, paralysis, death, failure to improve, spinal fluid leak, need for further surgery, cement extravasation, failure to improve her pain, and other potential complications have all been discussed.  The patient understands the issues involved.  She requested that we proceed with surgery as noted above and will come to the hospital for this surgery on 01/18/08.\n",

            "Note: REASON FOR VISIT: , This is a cosmetic consultation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a very pleasant 34-year-old white female who is a nurse in the operating room.  She knows me through the operating room and has asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her.  She is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery.  She has recently had some neck surgery for a re-fusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this.  Her current desires are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen, and she came to me mostly because I offer transumbilical breast augmentation.  Her breasts are reportedly healthy without any significant problems.  Her weight is currently stable.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: ,  Negative.  Past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 02/05 and in 09/06.  She has had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for Huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father.  Her brother has an aneurysm.  She does occasionally smoke and has been trying to quit recently.  She is currently smoking about a pack a day.  She drinks about once a week.  She is currently a registered nurse, circulator, and scrub technician in the operating room at Hopkins.  She has no children.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,A 12-system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain, mostly around her neck and thoracic region.  She does have occasional rash on her chest and problems with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain.  She has considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability.  Her last mammogram was in 2000.  She has a size 38C breast.,MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are 5 mg of methadone three times a day and amitriptyline at night as needed.,ALLERGIES: , None.,FINDINGS: , On exam today, the patient has good posture, good physique, good skin tone.  She is tanned.  Her lower abdomen has some excess adiposity.  There is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin.  Her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation.  There was no piercing in that region.  Her breasts are C shaped.  They are not ptotic.  They have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity.  She has no masses or lesions noted.  The nipples are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age.  Her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed.  Hopefully, our scars would be similar to this.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Hypomastia.  I think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely.  This would make her fill out her clothes much better, and I think transumbilical technique in her is a good option.  I have discussed with her the other treatment options, and she does not want scars around her breasts if at all possible.  I think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone.  I think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely.  I am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity, and I will discuss with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem, she may need a mini tummy tuck.  I do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she gets after the adiposity is removed.  I will try to set this up in the near future.  I will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure.  Due to her neck issues, we may not be able to perform her surgery but I will check with Dr. X to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused.\n",

EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  NEUROLOGICAL:  No focal deficits noted.  PELVIC:  Normal-appearing external genitalia.  Vaginal vault with no masses or bleeding.,LABORATORY DATA: , None today.,RADIOLOGIC DATA: , CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis from 01/28/08 revealed status post total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with an unremarkable vaginal cuff.  No local or distant metastasis.  Right probably chronic gonadal vein thrombosis.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a 67-year-old white female with history of uterine papillary serous carcinoma, status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and 6 cycles of carboplatin and Taxol chemotherapy.  She is doing well with no evidence of disease clinically or radiologically.,PLAN:,1.  Plan to follow her every 3 months and CT scans every 6 months for the first 2 years.,2.  The patient was advised to contact the primary physician for repeat blood pressure check and get started on antihypertensives if it is persistently elevated.,3.  The patient was told that the mole that she is mentioning in her head is no longer palpable and just to observe it for now.,4.  The patient was advised about doing Kegel exercises for urinary incontinence, and we will address this issue again during next clinic visit if it is persistent.,\n",

            "Note: HISTORY: , The patient is a 67-year-old female, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety.  At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my services at this time due to a plateau in her progress.  Numerous home activities were recommended to allow her to continue to make progress at home.\n",
